Or Martin Luther King Jr.? Many scholars believe that it comes down to three C''s; Character, Competence & Communication.\r\n <b>Character</b> \r\n Influence is based on trust and people first need to have confidence in your character to trust you. Character is who you are. In my opinion the most important parts of your character to develop are authenticity, humbleness and consistency. In order to build trust, and thus influence, you must have these three character traits. \r\n Unfortunately many people today try to compartmentalize their life, being one person in public, while they are someone totally different in private. The truth is, your true character always shows itself. Your character is who you are in totality. Are you trustworthy? Are you a good person? Do you care about others?\r\n We follow people because of their character.\r\n <b>Competence</b> \r\n Once people buy into who you are (character) they need to know that you have something to offer. Whether that is knowledge or skill (or both) - competency is essential for you to be influential.\r\n People who are competent not only let actions speak louder than words in their area of expertise, but they should have other people''s best interests at heart... those people that seek learning from them. \r\n The best way to increase your competency in any area is constant learning, practice and improvement. So make sure you take the time to become an expert in your field if you expect to have influence.\r\n <b>Communication</b> \r\n As a person with influence there is a message you wish you communicate, and if you can communicate it in an extremely engaging, concise and compelling way then it will be influential. Remember that verbal is only around 10% of communication, so you must also be a master of your non-verbal communication such as body language, intonation, facial expressions and eye contact.\r\n In order to be influential you must also give consideration to the channels with which you can communicate your message, and how you will engage people.\r\n Beyond the three C''s I believe the most important aspect of becoming influential is engaging with people on an emotional level, and genuinely trying to make friends with people. If you can genuinely connect with someone, then they are likely to trust your opinion. To connect with people you may not like, find something about them that you do like. ', 'The 3C''s of Influential People ', 'People follow you because of character that''s why it''s important to develop authenticity, humbleness and consistency. Competency is essential so you should become an expert in your field.

Always look for the best people to deal with, but make sure that everything is put into writing. Reading each contract thoroughly and negotiating amendments if necessary should be your guideline before signing any piece of paper for your business. Having a contract not only protects your business, it protects the other party and keeps you accountable too.\r\n There will be times that in order to maximise the marketability of your business, you will need to collaborate with other parties. Always make sure that these Ã¢â‚¬Å“outsidersÃ¢â‚¬Â? sign an NDA. Aside from an NDA, patent or copyright your products as soon as protection of intellectual property becomes important.  By doing so, you are securing legal ownership of your intellectual property & products. This way, your new business idea is protected from competitors who might be able to get ahead of you by implementing your ideas.\r\n It is important to keep yourself organized, especially in terms of all your documents and transactions. Filing each and every document for all your transactions is not overkill. If you are able to secure transaction documents, you can easily present a proof of what you agreed to.\r\n If it''s not in writing, email can be enough, but a one page contract signed by both parties is more binding and far more effective long term.

So if you want to go on a holiday, you can do that and not worry about the business. So, how do we get there? Good, solid planning and preparation. From day 1 you could be looking at those working with you to groom them into a management position where you could leave.\r\n By way of delegating tasks, you are actually giving more room to improve an individual''s expertise in one or some aspects of your business. This is also a good way of investing in your employees. Because when they beef up their skills, their value at work also increases. In fact, you may also want to consider investing in one or more of your employees by sending them to essential <a href=''http://www.builditgrowitbankit.com.au/'' target="_blank">seminars and workshops</a>, not only to improve the productivity and quality of your business, but to also decrease your supervision and most importantly, to reduce employee turnover. \r\n In some cases, turning your business into a learning organization will help.  Set a regular meeting where in you ensure that all issues and solutions are discussed on the floor with the whole team. This way, you can constantly develop new methods and work on new products or services and promulgate new knowledge to the team. Conducting these regular meetings will also encourage your team to deal with each other directly instead of coursing everything to you when there is an issue. This could save everyone''s time and can relieve you from attending to all issues. \r\n As always track and measure the effectiveness of the meetings. You may want to consider bringing in 3rd party facilitators to run them efficiently and with no bias.

You have to get up and get moving! You don''t have to be the one that increases sales all the time! Look internally at your team. Do you have someone that you could delegate some responsibility to for this? \r\n By delegating some tasks, you will be able to improve your business. The first step to do this is to be able to recognise when you need assistance. Check your current workload, responsibilities and some aspects of your business that stress you out. \r\n The next step is to decide what to delegate. Come up with a list of your projects or responsibilities and try to see which tasks will mostly likely require you to seek other''s assistance. Delegate those tasks that could probably use other''s expertise and experience when you collaborate with them. Your collaboration is most likely to succeed when you are able to delegate successfully.\r\n Scott Eblin came up with a five-step approach on delegation called <b>TRACK</b>:\r\n <b>Task:</b> Get really clear and specific in your own mind about the task you''re delegating and why it matters.\r\n <b>Request: </b>Make a clear request of the person you''re delegating the task to. Be sure to cover the what, when, why, who and in-bounds and out-of-bounds parameters for accomplishing the task.\r\n <b>Achieve:</b> As part of the delegation conversation, paint a picture of what success looks like when the task is achieved.\r\n <b>Check-ins:</b> Set up a process for checking in with each other over the course of completing the task. Most check-ins will be scheduled on a recurring basis. Be clear about the conditions for when the person you''re delegating to should initiate a check-in that''s not in the schedule.\r\n <b>Kudos and Knowledge: </b>When the task is complete, offer kudos for a job well done. Point out specific things that were done well and should be repeated in the future. Ask what was learned that could lead to an even better outcome next time.\r\n There will always be setbacks and issues in any business and delegating tasks to get things done is one of the things that may be able to address problems and stress.  Just be careful on who you delegate tasks, choose the right person to delegate and collaborate things with. The first time an issue arises, be firm, fair, and set some solid rules for what will happen should this come up again. Then, most importantly, follow those rules even if it means losing a team member you value. It''ll be best for the entire team down the road.', 'The How-To''s of delegation', 'Recognise when you need assistance. Decide what to delegate.

Sweat equity can also be applied to employees of a company who accept reduced wage or no pay at all in exchange for a level of ownership in the company.\r\n As the business owner, you should be the expert on valuing sweat equity.

Being competent is equally as important as being aggressive. Here are a few things to help you develop your competency:\r\n <b>Be a good listener.</b> \r\n To be an effective and competent leader, you must listen to your team. Pay attention to what your team has to say and implement others'' suggestions when appropriate to show them that you value their presence in your team.\r\n <b>Speak your mind.</b> \r\n When you are a good listener, you also must be able to express your opinions. This may encourage your team to do the same and will result in smarter decisions in your business. When you state your opinions, allow yourself to inspire and motivate your team by showing your sincerity and commitment to what you do.\r\n <b>Be positive.</b> \r\n Always look at the brighter side of things even if things don''t go as planned or expected. Be the first person to stand up tall be proactive in coming up with solutions to make the situation better. \r\n <b>Continually educate yourself.</b> \r\n If you want to be a competent and aggressive business leader, you need to continue to learn about your business. Take advantage of classes or seminars that are relevant to your business, and stay updated on industry trends and practices.

Hire a good accountant or your numbers will put you in hot water.\r\n A good accountant does not deliver exactly what is required, they are proactive and take an interest in everything you do as an entrepreneur.\r\n The first thing you should consider is the size of your business.  Small businesses usually do not have the volume of financial transactions that require a full-time accountant or bookkeeper. Hiring an external accountant or accounting firm on a consulting basis is a good way to start. An external accountant or accounting firm usually handles the following:\r\n<ul class="popUl">\r\n <li>Tax return preparation</li>\r\n <li>Preparing financial statements, including the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash</li>\r\n <li>Analysis or problem-solving advice</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nWhen your business grows in revenue, and the financial transactions become more complicated, you should start to consider hiring an in-house accountant.

Conduct a <a href=''http://www.builditgrowitbankit.com/'' target="_blank">brainstorming</a> activity with your sales personnel, who are closer to your market. Their insights based on their market and customer observation are valuable in developing your sales strategy to achieve higher sales. Remember to aim high on your sales goals, set a realistic target, but aim to exceed that target.\r\n <b>Reduce administrative charges</b> \r\n Cutting your administrative charges (also known as Ã¢â‚¬Å“selling, general and administrative expensesÃ¢â‚¬Â?) is a good way to increase profit, especially when the company is having a difficulty in increasing its sales. Review your <a href=''http://www.builditgrowitbankit.com/'' target="_blank">internal policies</a> and procedures and identify procedures that cost money and figure out ways to save some money. \r\n <b>Be mindful of your production expenses</b> \r\n <a href=''http://www.builditgrowitbankit.com/'' target="_blank">Proper management</a> of your production will definitely help you slash your production expenses.

I honestly believe there is an entrepreneur lying dormant within almost everyone. Most people have an innate desire to work for themselves and create their own destiny, rather than be dictated their daily activities by an employer.\r\n Entrepreneurship is not some special talent that people are born with.

If weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re negotiating with large investors or corporations, they expect to deal with firms they know. These big firms want to work with us Ã¢â‚¬â€? not because we pay big fees but because thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a chance weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be able to do so in the future. If you find yourself in this position, where you need to engage one of these firms, here are some of the things IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve learned to be especially clear about. Specifically, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not paying for:<br/> <strong>Sales meetings.</strong> Introductory meetings where the lawyers are selling their services should not be charged. And we need to know precisely when we leave the courtship stage.<br/> <strong>Reading irrelevant documents.</strong> Often a new lawyer will ask for all company documents to be sent through Ã¢â‚¬â€? even if theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not at all relevant to the job at hand. Recently, I was asked to send through a bunch of documents ahead of an introductory meeting so the lawyer could scope and cost out our job. I questioned why the documents were required and was told they were needed as background. When I received a bill for $3,000 for Ã¢â‚¬Å“readingÃ¢â‚¬Â? the documents, I disputed it Ã¢â‚¬â€? and won.<br/> <strong>Briefing internal colleagues.</strong> Once, I was working with a partner at a top firm in the city. Attempting to keep costs down, I was careful to keep my meetings with the partner short. This partner was the only lawyer I dealt with at the firm, but when I received the bill, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d been charged for tens of hours of work by someone else IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d never met. I was charged for one hour of the partnerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s time for each meeting and then another hour for the partner to brief a colleague and yet another hour for the equally expensive colleague to receive the briefing. I disputed this on the grounds that if someone else was going to do the work, I shouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to pay for this new person to be briefed internally.  <br/> <strong>Making things unnecessarily complicated.</strong> Sometimes legal deals and documents can be complicated and need a lot of tweaking, negotiating and explaining. But often theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re quite simple. Recently we undertook a friendly transaction with another business. Our lawyer drew up the contract and we had to show it to the other partyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lawyer for sign-off. It was a traightforward deal, and everyone involved just wanted the other lawyer to say it was O.K. or flag any issues. Instead, the lawyer took two weeks and sent back a document that was almost completely reworded but said exactly the same thing. Of course, we also got a hefty legal bill.', 'Things that we should not be paying for when engaging services from a lawyer', 'Sales meetings. Reading irrelevant documents.

I have to accept that networking doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t come naturally to me, and thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hard. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a perfectionist. I like to be good at things. So IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve developed techniques to help me form relationships and improve, even enjoy, the networking process. If you, too, struggle with networking, here are a few ideas that may help.<br/> <strong>Have short conversations with lots of people. Follow up later.</strong> <br/> I find it difficult to form deep connections at events. Instead, I try to have short conversations with as many people as possible, making sure I have their contact information so I can follow up later. If I see someone I want to talk to, I politely dart in and say, Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sorry to interrupt, but such and such suggested we meet. I have to run in a minute and just wanted to get your business card so I can follow up later.Ã¢â‚¬Â? ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quite hard for people to say no to this. And then after the event, I reach out and set up lunch or coffee. <br/> <strong>Focus on what youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re good at. </strong> <br/> Although I find large informal groups a challenge, I know that I perform well in formal presentation settings or one-on-one conversations. Instead of worrying about my inability to charm at large-group events, I focus my on my more natural ability to engage people one-on-one and to speak publicly. If you can kill it in a one-on-one presentation, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all you need to do to build a network.<br/> <strong>ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about forming a few close relationships. </strong> <br/> Some people have hundreds or even thousands of people in their network. Other than on social networks where I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know most of the people to whom IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m supposedly connected, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d say my close business network includes about 15 people, but they are special. Every year, I meet between one and three people who are magic.

ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also a big difference between people who think they know how to build a company like ours and those who have actually done it.<br/> I can think of four people who have helped me at Posse and without whom we would have failed. But the new phase we are entering requires a new group of advisers. Here is some of what IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m looking for:<br/> <strong>Previous success in similar fields.</strong> Some of the people I enlisted to my early advisory board sounded impressive. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d held high-level positions at big corporate companies. When we suffered some early start-up bumps, though, they were unprepared. Their knowledge of how a start-up should grow was based on watching Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Social Network.Ã¢â‚¬Â? When we didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hit it big straight out the gate, they became concerned. I learned to look for people who had built a similar company from the ground up.<br/> <strong>Focus on the granular.</strong> Many people who want to give me advice start with a discussion about the potential size of the exit and how quickly weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be able to get there. This always creates distractions such as attending to the setting up of complicated corporate structures to minimize future tax or setting up big sales deals ahead of building a product. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve found that the best advisers are the ones who drill me on what we have to achieve in the next three months. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re interested in the granular metrics of the business, how we can improve them and how we can create replicable processes.<br/> Good start-ups are rarely short of willing advisers. Maybe these people are looking for involvement in something that looks like fun; maybe they seek a slice of a big exit. But IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve developed a keen radar for time wasters. I spend as much time as possible getting to know someone before inviting them to become involved. I do thorough reference checks and never give away shares in the company without a vesting period.<br/> When I do find someone whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right, I recognize that the relationship has value. Such people are usually in high demand; theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re giving up other opportunities to take a risk and help me. Time is their most valuable asset, so I make sure IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m prepared for meetings and I check in regularly to make sure that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re happy with our progress and that they enjoy being involved.', 'What to look for when hiring advisers', 'Previous success in similar fields.

Two divorced within the first four years but still run successful businesses as a team Ã¢â‚¬â€? not without some pain, I imagine.<br/> The other couple grew stronger. Melanie Perkins and Cliff Obrecht have been running companies together for the last seven years. Two years ago they founded an online graphic design company, <a href="https://www.canva.com/" title="The company''s website." target="blank">Canva</a>, that is going through a growth explosion, with more than 750,000 users in the first year. They appear to have the perfect partnership Ã¢â‚¬â€? they complement each otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strengths and drive the business forward in tandem.<br/> In an effort to understand why Mel and Cliff have thrived as partners, while so many others, myself included, have struggled, I asked them to share their secrets. HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s MelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s advice:<br/> <strong>Keep the dream alive.</strong> Mel says she and Cliff have always been clear about what their vision is for the business. Every day they talk about what Canva will look like in five to 10 years. Ã¢â‚¬Å“When you know what you both want to build,Ã¢â‚¬Â? she said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“it makes every little decision easier. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re all steps toward a shared dream.Ã¢â‚¬Â?<br/> <strong>Have unstructured conversations.</strong> Ã¢â‚¬Å“We do lots of walking where weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re free to have crazy conversations and brainstorm ideas,Ã¢â‚¬Â? she said, adding that in business, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy to have rigid boardroom-type discussions in which everyone is afraid to speak openly for fear of side-tracking the meeting.<br/> <strong>DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t keep battle scars.</strong> Once a decision is made, it becomes a team decision. There is always discussion, but what matters is working toward the shared vision. Ã¢â‚¬Å“We always focus on the best outcome for the business,Ã¢â‚¬Â? she said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Once something is agreed, the process behind the decision isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mentioned again.Ã¢â‚¬Â?<br/> <strong>Build trust over time.</strong> Mel describes how, during the first few years of working together, they were both involved in everything. Over time, as the company has grown, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve developed trust and chosen to focus on different areas. Ã¢â‚¬Å“WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in business together because we believe in each otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s skills,Ã¢â‚¬Â? she said. Ã¢â‚¬Å“ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s great that we each get to play to our strengths, because it means we can cover a lot of ground.Ã¢â‚¬Â?<br/> <strong>Have the same expectations of each other.</strong> Ã¢â‚¬Å“Both of us have an extremely high work ethic,Ã¢â‚¬Â? Mel said.

I start off knowing that I need someone to perform a task, and imagine what qualities that person might possess. How, in a sea of people, can I find my ideal candidate?<br/> Earlier this year I signed up to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/16/business/smallbusiness/online-recruiting-efforts-gain-ground.html" target="_blank" >LinkedInÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Recruiter service</a>. For $2,200 per quarter, I can run detailed searches on exactly the type of candidates IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m looking for and then approach them en masse. I can search by location, previous and current job titles, previous employers, which universities they attended and how long theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been in their current jobs.<br/> As a small-business owner, I recognize that building the right team is crucial. We only have room for A-plus players, who will always be in good positions and may require quite a bit of convincing to leave. LinkedIn gives us access to the passive job hunter market that used to be available only through expensive recruiters, and it helps us seek out top quality candidates from within other companies.<br/> There is one catch. If IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m trying to poach the best people from our competitors, I can be sure that theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re trying to steal my best people, too. Once we turned down an acquisition offer from a competitor only to have the company approach all of our staff members individually on LinkedIn.<br/> This is almost impossible to prevent, but IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve come up with a couple of strategies that may help. First, if your business is small, I see little benefit in setting up a LinkedIn page for it. Doing so just enables competitors to find and attack all your staff members at once.<br/> Second, you can try to discourage your staffers from using the platform Ã¢â‚¬â€œ although this is nearly impossible. When we relocated team members from Sydney to New York, a recruiter suggested that I ask our engineers not to change their location on LinkedIn because it would highlight them as fresh meat for the hungry New York recruiters.', 'How Linkedin can help with your recruitment', 'LinkedIn gives us access to the passive job hunter market that used to be available only through expensive recruiters, and it helps us seek out top quality candidates from within other companies.

I certainly know that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve awakened in a sweat the night before I have to have Ã¢â‚¬Å“the conversationÃ¢â‚¬Â? with someone. Or worse, I have put off the conversation and let the frustration and anticipation build for months.<br/> Letting someone go is never an easy process, but here is some of what IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve learned.<br/> <strong>Let them save face.</strong> <br/> Whenever I sit down with people, I make it as obvious as I can whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about to come. I ask them how they think their role is working out. I never make it about their personal contribution; itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s always about the role and how it fits into the organization. I lead them toward seeing that, in a small company like ours, their role isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t quite what we need. <br/> You may think itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dishonest not to be upfront and tell them exactly why they havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t worked out. But by the time we reach this point, we will already have had several conversations about whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not working and how they can improve. This conversation is about making a tough moment easier and helping ensure they have the confidence to move on with their life.<br/> <strong>DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t procrastinate. </strong> <br/> IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve discovered that when I think someone wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work out, they wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. I can recognize when IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve made a recruitment mistake within the first three months, and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll let them go within a week of the realization. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve found that the longer I leave it, the more they bond with the team and the worse the impact. It gives the person and the company the opportunity to move on.<br/> <strong>Stick to any agreements. When in doubt, be generous.</strong> <br/> All of our employment agreements have probationary periods of three months. If the person is let go in that time, we pay one weekÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s notice. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s important that there be no doubt about what the person should be paid. If thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ever a question, I err on the generous side. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not good to look stingy, and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve learned that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s important to do whatever I can to make the person leaving as happy as possible.<br/> <strong>Be clear about what happens next and help them as much as you can.</strong> <br/> At the end of our conversation, I lay out the next steps. TheyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll usually agree to go back to the office and hand over anything important to another team member, and we agree on how to explain the departure. <br/> We then talk about their plan to find another job. I ask if theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d like introductions to my contacts, and I offer to write them a glowing (but honest) reference. <br/> <strong>Announce it to the team together and let them say goodbye.</strong> <br/> We go back to the office and call the team together for the announcement. We almost always paint it as the employeeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s decision. I just stand there while the person explains. I thank them for their contributions, and we all go out for a drink.

My company is not raising money at the moment, but the fund had heard about <a href="https://posse.com/" target="_blank" >Posse</a> and reached out to me online. Since I was in town anyway, I decided to meet with the fundÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s investors and build a relationship. <br/> Two senior executives from the other side of the world knew my lifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story and didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mind reciting it. I felt naked.<br/> Knowing that such web searches before meetings would become more common, I decided to take control of my online brand. HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve done.<br/> <strong>1. Think about why.</strong> <br/> If your only concern is that people will conduct searches on you before meetings, you may just need to create a LinkedIn profile so they will find something that you want them to see.<br/> For me, though, the purpose of building an online brand was bigger. I wanted to raise the profile of my company in order to win clients, attract users and raise capital.<br/> <strong>2. Define your brand.</strong> <br/> As entrepreneurs we create brand values for our companies but often not for ourselves. By writing down my values, I defined my personal brand and made it easier to make sure that my values are projected across everything I do online. This included the way my own blog is written, the types of other publications I write for and what I post in social media. As with a company brand, I try to ensure that the message is consistent.<br/> <strong>3. Understand that social networks are the new calling cards.</strong> <br/> If you are on social media, people are going to check out your profiles. LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram will come up first, often in that order.<br/> <strong>4. Pay attention to what comes up first in Google.</strong> <br/> One reason to write a blog with your name in the URL is that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s likely to pop up first on any Google search. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s also helpful to have a name that isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t common. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m lucky with my first name, which has a less common spelling, and my blog ranks high if you search Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rebekah Campbell.Ã¢â‚¬Â?<br/> If there were bad things written about me online (there arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t), I would try to create new listings that would rank highly in Google and push the old links to the second page of search results. If you search your own name and nothing comes up, or if an early link displays something youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d prefer to keep under wraps, consider creating a LinkedIn page.

The family lawyer who helped establish our companies suggested that I create a board before I raised our first investment round and that I try to find some high profile people to join it. His objective was to make the team slide in my presentation deck look as impressive as possible. Off I went to enlist some big name folks to join my not-yet-established company.<br/> Putting the right group together is challenging. Three years in, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m on my third lineup, after experiencing the best and worst of what boards can do. Here are five things IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve learned the hard way.<br/> <strong>Make sure your directors have the right experience</strong>.<br/> Many people imagine that a board should consist of gray-haired gentlemen with high profiles in the business community along with friends who will invest in the business. My original board sounded impressive, but many were impressive in the wrong industries. They had no experience with the challenges a start-up like ours might face. So I received bad advice which led us to hire the wrong team and spend too much too quickly. <br/> <strong>Make sure you invite people you like and trust.</strong> <br/> Directors have a power. They decide who leads the company, what deals to do and when to exit, so you must all share the same vision. You must know they will do the right thing, that they will stick around and support you when you hit tough times. <br/> I spent a lot of time with each of our existing directors before I asked them to join. I knew I could trust them to act in the best interests of the company and to stick it out. <br/> <strong>Keep the numbers small.</strong> <br/> We have four directors on our current board, including me, and one regular observer who acts like a director but doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t vote. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a tight group: Everyone knows the othersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ strengths; everyone is committed to making Posse a hit. For me, the benefit of having a small board is that I can spend time with each person regularly. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s no delay when we need to make an important decision. Everyone is in touch with whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s happening and can contribute.<br/> <strong>Set expectations up front.</strong> <br/> ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy to procrastinate when finalizing deals with advisers and directors. Everyone is there to be helpful, and at the start, it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seem worth negotiating to pay them a share of nothing. The problems kick in after a few months when things start going well and you realize that you and they have different expectations about payment. <br/> You must determine what you expect of directors. How will they help with fund-raising, strategy, introductions and the like? If appropriate, you might want to agree on how much time they will commit Ã¢â‚¬â€? although when you have the right people on board itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s likely theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll bug you with ideas and suggestions for how they can help. Although these conversations can be awkward at the beginning, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve found that the directors who are best at negotiating their own deals are the ones who are most helpful when I am negotiating deals for Posse.<br/> <strong>Be transparent and organized. </strong> <br/> Your board should be the one group of people with whom you can be completely transparent. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s their job to help you work through challenges; they must understand those challenges if theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to add value. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve also found that board meetings are much more effective when IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve put time into considering the agenda and have written a presentation to talk through.<br/> The names on our board are impressive but thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not why theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re there. A top-notch board of great people with relevant experience and a shared vision has made my founderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s journey easier and more fun.', 'How to build the right group of board', 'Make sure your directors have the right experience.

I worked around the clock; he liked to surf in the morning and had a personal work-life balance rule that precluded staying in the office after 5 p.m.<br/> ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s frustrating to work harder than a partner who shares equally in the success of the business. This time, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll make sure that my co-founder and I have the same expectations for what we want to achieve and how weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll get there.<br/> <strong>Similar aptitudes and complementary skills.</strong> <br/> Two heads are better than one Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but only if the co-founder is smart and views problems from a different perspective. My previous co-founder used to refer every decision to me; that way, he never had to say no to anyone. It was always Ã¢â‚¬Å“RebekahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s decisionÃ¢â‚¬Â? not to give employees what they wanted. Along with being annoying, this didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work because no one challenged me.<br/> I also think it would help to have a co-founder with complementary skills. For example, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a strong external marketer and sales person. It would be ideal to find a partner who is better at operations and finances.<br/> <strong>Similar approach to resolving problems.</strong> <br/> One reasons start-ups fail is because the founders fall out. They often start out as friends, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s great when things go well. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s when times get tough, which they almost always do, that partners squabble. They blame each other. One isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t as smart, makes a wrong call or doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t put in the work. This kills confidence with both the investors and the team, and it can even kill the business. Founder divorce has to be one of the most painful and draining experiences you can go through.<br/> This time, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll make sure IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m comfortable that my co-founder and I will be able to work through problems proactively. There will be times when we disagree, but we will have a process in place to resolve these situations.<br/> Finding the right business partner is like finding the right life partner.

Often, candidates who respond well during the interview process turn out to be disappointing after they start. Within two weeks, I know IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve made a mistake.<br/> When I started <a href="https://posse.com/" target="_blank" >Posse</a>, I hired a team of 12 in the first year and appointed five directors. I remember looking around the table at our Christmas lunch a year later and realizing that every single person that IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d hired in those first 12 months had left, including four of the directors. So, I had a problem: Either I was terrible at picking people, or I wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢tÃ‚Â  managing them successfully after they started.<br/> My new board started to ask questions. I attended a couple of management courses and hired a leadership coach. I learned several things I could do to improve our recruitment process and how I worked with new employees in their first few weeks. I also learned that even the best managers claim at best an 80 percent success rate. No matter how good I become, at least one in five new hires are not going to work out. <br/> Recently weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve been scaling up again, and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve hired a bunch of new people. All of the concepts I learned during my training have helped, and our group is strong, but until a few weeks ago, I felt uneasy. Had I nailed it this time? An ambitious start-up like ours will only succeed with anÃ‚Â A-plus team. Steve Jobs famously said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“A small team of A-plus players can run circles around a giant team of B and C players.Ã¢â‚¬Â?<br/> IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve spent a lot of time analyzing the situation, trying to determine the factors that distinguish an A-plus employee from a B-plus employee. Mr. Jobs spoke about trusting your gut Ã¢â‚¬â€œ how you feel when youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re with the person. This may be great advice if you have his gut, but it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work for me. I tend to like everyone, and that makes it tougher.<br/> We have some excellent players on our team. I look around my office as I write this blog, and it occurs to me that they all share three traits: drive, cultural fit and raw intelligence. These will be the things I look for as I continue to build my team.<br/> <strong>Drive: </strong>What is their personal ambition and drive, and are they happy with their achievements at Posse? What do they want? The best employees arrive at the office full of ideas to share: They have been thinking about Posse at night and canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t wait to put their ideas into action. By contrast, B players just put in the hours. They smile but drop comments indicating that they are looking forward to Friday, or that Monday is not their favorite day of the week. Personally, I love Monday mornings Ã¢â‚¬â€œ I have a full week to make stuff happen before we have to stop for the weekend.<br/> IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve found that one good way of assessing a prospective employeeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drive is to review their careers. One of the people I hired recently had done a lot of volunteer work in politics. It was obvious that this was her passion. She interviewed well, and I hired her. But after she started, all she talked about was politics. Posse was just a job to earn money; she could never be A-plus. An A-plus player is likely to have passions outside work, but not passions theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d rather be doing than being on the team at Posse.<br/> <strong>Cultural fit: </strong>A thriving team of A-plus players feels amazing, everyone bursting with ideas and enthusiasm. The energy is electric. But it takes only one negative person Ã¢â‚¬â€? someone who doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t believe in or care about the vision Ã¢â‚¬â€? to bring down everyone else. It goes back to what Mr. Jobs said about trusting your gut. How does the person make you feel? The problem is, I find it hard to know how I feel about someone until IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve spent quite a lot of time with them. I fall in love with everyone quickly but then fall out of love just as fast.<br/> Recently, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve narrowed the field of candidates to two or three people that I like and then invited them to meet the rest of the team. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve done this five times in the last year, and twice the team rejected all of the candidates. Once, I overrode the team Ã¢â‚¬â€? I was sure he was the right person, and we really needed to fill the position.<br/> Within a month, I knew I had made a mistake. In team brainstorming sessions, where everyone would throw out crazy ideas, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d sit in the corner and criticize. I know that teams need all types to work effectively, but negativity is a killer. Some people told me privately that they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t feel comfortable sharing ideas in a group format any more; they were afraid heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d criticize them.<br/> <strong>Raw intelligence or talent: </strong>In the past, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve considered experience and connections when hiring. In fact, these are not relevant to a small ambitious business like ours; experience is often a bad thing. On several occasions, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve hired people from big-name companies, and they arrived at Posse expecting that things would work in a similar fashion.<br/> Now, I can identify talent and intelligence during the interview process. One of the best people who recently joined our team was employed at a consulting company with which we were working. I had seen the quality of her work over a couple of months and knew she was a superstar. The other two great hires weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve made have been previous colleagues of existing team members. If I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know the person, then I ask lots of questions during the interview process in which the candidate must think in order to come up with a creative answer. I also ask pure logic questions just to get a sense of how they process information and generate solutions.<br/> In the past, I have not had a lot of success picking the best talent, but I have learned to recognize stars and hold onto them once theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve also learned to let go of mistakes quickly. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m happy to report that our current team is pumping, which is good.

IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m good at getting meetings with the right people and getting them excited, but I suffer from recurring attacks of what I call First Meeting Syndrome. My first meeting is red hot, but I struggle to get a follow-up; time passes and the deal goes cold. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a great door-opener, but IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not so good at closing the deal.<br/> Over the past year, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve wondered: What am I doing wrong? How come IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m so good at initial meetings but so lousy at following through? I asked mentors for advice, and I tracked folks who are killer salespeople in order to learn what their magic was at meetings.<br/> Here are a few of the things I learned:<br/> <strong>Get the other company to do the talking.</strong> <br/> I used to spend a lot of time preparing for meetings. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d research the company, come up with a range of suggestions and try to impress them with my presentation. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d talk for 80 percent of the meeting.<br/> One mentor suggested that I make my first meeting all about them. Rather than arriving with a fully developed proposal, spend most of the time asking about their strategy. Then describe what Posse does and try to generate partnership ideas together.<br/> <strong>ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all about the person.</strong> <br/> When I planned my presentation, I thought it through as though I were pitching to Visa, Coke or the like, and structured it according to my expectations of what Coke wanted to achieve. But in reality, there is no such thing as pitching to a company; I can only pitch to one or two people who happen to work for that company. I have to sell to <em>them</em>.<br/> <strong>Deal with the most senior person.</strong> <br/> Senior executives are generally more prepared to take a risk while their juniors tend to worry about making mistakes.<br/> <strong>Leave a written presentation.</strong> <br/> It is easier to visualize a product when thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a tangible booklet to flip though. I also learned that after the meetings people would pass the presentation around to colleagues. And many of the people I meet with are in their 50s or older and may be more comfortable with paper presentations.<br/> <strong>Create time pressure. </strong> <br/> Daily deal sites like Groupon and Living Social were successful initially because of the scarcity principle, the concept that consumers want now what they fear may not be available tomorrow. The same is true if you are trying to sell some kind of deal or partnership. People are unlikely to say yes today if they think can say yes next week.<br/> <strong>Be persistent. </strong> <br/> After a meeting, I used to send a follow-up email, but many of the people I meet with are too busy to respond to nonurgent emails from start-ups; they hit delete and consign my missive to the bit bucket. Now, I go straight to the phone. I feel uncomfortable making the call, but when I reach people, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re always pleasant.<br/> As the founder of a tiny start-up, I learned that I needed all of these tricks to close my media partnership deal. I worked on the most senior person in the organization, asked executives about their strategy, let them come up with the ideas, showed how the project would make them look innovative and reduced the level of risk by guaranteeing that I would make sure it succeeded.', 'Tips in closing deals', 'Get the other company to do the talking.

With each new artist, we would start from scratch with no profile, no fan base and no money to spend on marketing. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d work out how to develop a brand and how to reach the right community of early adopters.<br/> Most bands give up before they reach 10,000 fans. After a while, I learned that if I developed a fan base of 10,000 and the music appealed to a wide market, the next several hundred thousand fans were relatively easy to come by. <br/> Here are a few tricks I learned building fan bases for bands that I also used to build a community for Posse: <br/> <strong>DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t underestimate the value of passionate fans.</strong> <br/> The best way to experience a new band is in a small venue crammed with screaming fans. These taste makers become the first to discover a new talent, and they will later say, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I saw them at X with 200 other people, and now theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re playing stadiums.Ã¢â‚¬Â? <br/> PosseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s strategy for building that initial base involves a student adviser program. We advertise on free student job boards all over the world, seeking advisers to intern from home. They commit to completing two activities a week during a four-week program, and in exchange we provide them with a letter for their rÃƒÂ©sumÃƒÂ©.<br/> The activities include running user-experience tests, writing up product feedback and suggestions, recruiting friends to join Posse, promoting Posse to retailers in their area with stickers for the store windows, and writing blog posts about the best places in their town. We run the program every four weeks and aim to sign up 150 advisers.<br/> <strong>Leverage other peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fan bases.</strong> <br/> In music, the easiest way to build a fan base is by landing a support slot with a major artist. When the band performs as an opening act, thousands of music lovers get to see them.<br/> At Posse, we feature high-profile people on our blog in the hope that we will attract their followers. We publish two or three blog posts every day from celebrities, highlighting their lists of favorite spots to eat, drink and shop in their hometowns. <br/> Our community manager Chris writes up the blogs and encourages our featured celebrities to share them on Facebook and Twitter, which they usually do, often to hundreds of thousands of followers. He also reaches out to each of the featured stores, and they all post and tweet the link. Everyone is looking for content to post on social media, and the blog posts generate a huge amount of traffic for Posse.<br/> <strong>Make sure the product has natural momentum.</strong> <br/> When I started Posse, I thought our initial version of the product was great Ã¢â‚¬â€? but it didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t gain momentum. People didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t share it with friends, and users would drop off right after signing up. I remembered my discovery from music management: If people donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t love the product, and it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t grow organically, no amount of marketing will save it. I have spent two years improving Posse, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s now reached a monthly growth rate in new users of 15 percent, without marketing. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re almost at the point where IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be confident enough to start spending marketing money.<br/> ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a graveyard for businesses that fail to commit the time and effort to build a community of fans. Many spend a fortune on marketing too early Ã¢â‚¬â€œ before the product has gained natural momentum and before there are committed customers. No one wants to watch a band in an empty room. Finding the right first 10,000 fans takes careful thought, hard work and patience.', 'Tricks for building fan bases', 'DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t underestimate the value of passionate fans.

Chris is stressed because he can&rsquo;t control his co-worker and her vindictive behaviour. &nbsp;He lies awake fretting about what she&rsquo;s going to do next.<br>Control is one area where we entrepreneurs have it much better. &nbsp;Sure, it&rsquo;s stressful when we have to rely on other people, but there&rsquo;s usually something we can do about it. &nbsp;The next day we can scope out new investors or cut costs. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re never at the mercy of someone else. &nbsp;Chris feels as if he&rsquo;s out of control but he&rsquo;s a talented, hard working guy; he could always quit and find another job. &nbsp;To remove &lsquo;control&rsquo; as a stress factor I must remember that I&rsquo;m ultimately in control.&nbsp;<br><strong>Expectation:</strong> <br>Another major cause of stress comes from worrying that things won&rsquo;t work out the way I&rsquo;d hoped. &nbsp;Much of the pain that I experience, lying in bed waiting on an investor to email, comes from a future I&rsquo;ve created in my head &ndash; a future where our investment round closes smoothly &ndash; a future that may not exist. &nbsp;This feeling is similar to grief. &nbsp;When I suffered the loss of someone very close to me, much of the pain was for the loss of a future I&rsquo;d imagined. &nbsp;I think it&rsquo;s healthy to hope for an investment round to close or for a product to take off, to plan and work towards those goals. &nbsp;But I also think it&rsquo;s important to remember that the future hasn&rsquo;t arrived.&nbsp; The only thing that&rsquo;s for sure is now.<br><strong>Perception:</strong> <br>Last year, I wrote <a href="http://www.rebekahcampbell.com/2013/06/18/on-jealousy/" target="_blank" title="On jealousy">a post about professional jealously</a>. &nbsp;I was flooded with emails and Facebook messages, so obviously it struck a chord with many people. &nbsp;I find it difficult to avoid comparing myself to other people or worry about what others think of me. &nbsp;I know this is pointless but it&rsquo;s very hard to stop. &nbsp;&nbsp;When I compare myself to others, it always leaves me thinking that something&rsquo;s wrong with me, which knocks my self-confidence. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s crazy to worry about what others think of me because no one actually cares much about what I&rsquo;m doing. &nbsp;Everyone has their own stuff going on. &nbsp;The world is big and I am small.<br><strong>Self esteem: &nbsp;</strong> <br>Often, people who seem the most confident externally (like entrepreneurs) are, behind it all, the least. &nbsp;They just act confident to compensate for that voice inside their head that tells them they&rsquo;re not good enough. &nbsp;Self-esteem and self-confidence &ndash; that&rsquo;s a whole other issue.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll write about that later. &nbsp;I do believe that, through cultivating a deep sense of self-belief, I could kill stress entirely.<br>Stress is an invisible energy drain; it wears us down. &nbsp;It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you&rsquo;re a struggling startup entrepreneur like me or you have a corporate job like Chris.&nbsp; We all suffer. &nbsp;With so much opportunity out there in the world, I want all the energy I can have. &nbsp;This year, rather than work on ways to manage stress, I&rsquo;m going to address its root causes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I&rsquo;ll be able to relax my stress-reducing routines and have a bit more fun as well.', 'End the root causes of stress', 'Control.

Productivity &amp; Community. &nbsp;</strong> <br>The first issue I had to address was low team morale and lack of productivity.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve found that one of the best ways to lift morale immediately when you&rsquo;re in a slump is &ndash; communicate with everyone every day. &nbsp; This enables you to reinforce the company&rsquo;s objectives, ensure that everyone&rsquo;s ideas and concerns are heard, and create transparency. <br><strong>2. Location.</strong> <br>I worked in the garage office for six weeks and hated it.&nbsp;I started looking for new premises as soon as I returned to Australia, and with a bit of effort found an awesome spot on Oxford St, in the heart of Sydney&rsquo;s trendy shopping and cafe district. It&rsquo;s a delight to arrive at work in the morning, and I often find myself working late into the evening with several members of the team.&nbsp; People want to stay behind and work because it&rsquo;s an awesome place to be.<br><strong>3. Offsite events.</strong> <br>Every 3 &ndash; 6 months we hold a company offsite, renting a house in the country and spending a couple of days discussing our progress and planning for the future.&nbsp; A few weeks ago, we went to the Blue Mountains and were there when the fires broke out!&nbsp; We spent two days reviewing our company values and user personas, brainstorming user stories, featuring ideas for the product, and prioritising the next few months of marketing and development.&nbsp; We had a great time together and returned to work excited about the future.<br><strong>4. Progress. &nbsp;</strong> <br>No matter how great your culture may be, a smart team only remains motivated if they feel they&rsquo;re making progress.&nbsp; Nothing is more disheartening than slogging it out on site, then marketing a product that people don&rsquo;t use.&nbsp; <br><strong>5. Celebrating wins.</strong> <br>Every start-up has a mile-long list of desired achievements.&nbsp; Every time we finish something, I&rsquo;ve mentally moved on to other things that haven&rsquo;t yet been completed.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s hard to stop and celebrate victories, but it&rsquo;s incredibly important for team morale.&nbsp; <br>The dictionary definition of company culture is:&nbsp; &lsquo;The behaviour of humans who are part of an organization and the meanings that the people attach to their actions.&rsquo; I think culture determines how excited team members are to come into work in the morning.&nbsp; <br>Culture can&rsquo;t be dictated.&nbsp; For instance, I&rsquo;ve learned that mandating work hours doesn&rsquo;t lift productivity but inviting everyone to a team breakfast does. Startups can&rsquo;t afford the time or money to build culture in the same way as Google.&nbsp; We have to be creative, using what attracts people to work at a startup in the first place.&nbsp; People join startups because they want to make an impact, for their ideas to be heard.&nbsp; They want to be a part of building something they believe in, to sense rapid progress and be part of a tight team that has fun and respects each other.&nbsp; None of this costs much money &ndash; just a bit of effort and creative thinking.', 'Building a company culture', 'Productivity & Community.

Outsourcing the development of a minimum viable product. </strong> <br>When I started Posse, I wanted to get a site up as soon as possible to see if the model worked.&nbsp; I had no technical expertise and didn&rsquo;t know how long it would take or how much it should cost.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t have enough expertise to hire my own developer so I outsourced to a dev shop in Sydney who then outsourced much of the work to their team in India.&nbsp; <br>But the approach was flawed and I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it.&nbsp; Having a team of part-time developers in Sydney meant that no one was focused on the project.&nbsp; A startup struggling to devise a new model needs focus and commitment.&nbsp; I wanted smart people who&rsquo;d wake in the middle of the night with brilliant ideas for the site design and implementation.&nbsp; But for them, we were a one- or two-day per week project.&nbsp; No-one cared that much, the design was poorly conceived and riddled with bugs.&nbsp; The code was sloppy; it wouldn&rsquo;t scale, and was abandoned when we put our own team in place.&nbsp; It had to be.<br><strong>2. Partial outsourcing of development. </strong> <br>As soon as I closed our first funding round, I hired a CTO to run the development of our product right here.&nbsp; To develop as much as possible on the available budget he decided to hire two other developers in-house and outsource the rest to a different team in India.&nbsp; <br>This approach worked slightly better as our Sydney team was more focused on the product design.&nbsp; We started running regular user tests and developed agile processes, and the Indian team were quicker and more responsive in our direct dealings with them.<br>Again there were drawbacks.&nbsp; The Sydney team spent a lot of time writing specs for the team in India.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s impossible for a technical spec to cover every decision that the implementer has to make.&nbsp; For every major definition in the spec there were a hundred micro decisions left to the Indian developer.&nbsp; We&rsquo;d never met them; they didn&rsquo;t speak good English, or understand the business problem we were trying to solve.&nbsp; So, they often came up with wrong decisions.&nbsp; <br><strong>3. Outsourced sales and database management.</strong> <br>One of the biggest lessons I learned from the music site was that we needed a scalable sales process. &nbsp; I looked for a way to streamline the client on-boarding process so it could be done by anyone from anywhere at low cost.&nbsp; Now, when you recommend a shop on Posse, a call centre in Manila contacts the store owner, lets them know you&rsquo;ve recommended them and asks if they&rsquo;d like to list on the site.&nbsp;<br>The process works incredibly well for us.&nbsp; <br><strong>4. Building our own team in Manila</strong> <br>Now that we&rsquo;re growing, we&rsquo;ve decided to launch our own team in Manila.&nbsp; I went over there last week to scope out the scene and investigate different approaches.&nbsp; I learned about Manila&rsquo;s thriving startup scene and was shown two of the largest startup incubators, packed with enthusiastic entrepreneurs and engineers building their own products.<br>Through trialling different methods of outsourcing and learning from others who&rsquo;ve done it well, I value the time and effort put into getting it right.', 'Some lessons learned from outsourcing', 'Outsourcing the development of a minimum viable product.

You set the culture.</strong>&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing more frustrating than being in partnership with someone who isn&rsquo;t nearly as driven or hard working as you are. This not only feels unfair but it also affects the culture of your company: the rest of the team follows the leaders, and if one of the leaders is lazy then it&rsquo;s hard to create an ambitious and hardworking culture.<br><strong>2. It&rsquo;s easier to make decisions quickly.</strong>&nbsp; No one is right all the time, but if you made the leap to start a business then you obviously are confident enough in your own ability to back yourself.&nbsp; Different people have different visions and different priorities.&nbsp; Start-ups have to move quickly to gain momentum on a tight time frame.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s good to deliberate but it&rsquo;s important to make decisions quickly.&nbsp; <br><strong>3. You can&rsquo;t fall out with yourself.</strong>&nbsp; One of the top reasons startups fail is the founders fall out.&nbsp; They often start out as friends and it&rsquo;s great when things are going well.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s when times get tough partners squabble. It kills confidence with the investors, the team and very often kills the business. &nbsp; <br><strong>4. Sole founders learn more.</strong>&nbsp; You are responsible for everything, not just the bits that you like or are good at.&nbsp; You need to understand financial modelling, team building, product design, sales, marketing, community, HR and operations.&nbsp; When there&rsquo;s a problem, there&rsquo;s no one else to turn to.&nbsp; You need to solve it.&nbsp; Although this has been difficult and tedious at times, when I reflect, I&rsquo;m glad that I&rsquo;ve done it.&nbsp;<br><strong>Why to have a co-founder:</strong> <br><strong>1. You&rsquo;ll make better decisions and are more likely to reach the right outcome faster.</strong>&nbsp; Two heads are better than one.&nbsp; As long as your co-founder is smart and approaches problems from a perspective that differs from your own, through a process of debate, you&rsquo;ll arrive at better decisions.&nbsp; <br><strong>2. It&rsquo;s easier to lead a team.&nbsp; </strong>One key role of a founder is to work with, listen to the team, articulate strategy, and keep everyone motivated.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s hard to do this when you&rsquo;re not in the same physical location.&nbsp; Multiple founders mean that someone can lead investment discussions, someone can run marketing and PR and someone can be with the team at the same time.&nbsp; A strong founding team allows everyone to focus on their strengths, and you can get a lot more done.<br><strong>3. It&rsquo;s more fun.&nbsp;</strong> If you&rsquo;re thinking of starting a company by yourself, don&rsquo;t underestimate how lonely and dark it will be when times are tough.&nbsp; I would have loved to have a partner to balance out the hard times and to celebrate with when things went well.&nbsp; <br><strong>4. Co-founders are more fundable.</strong>&nbsp; In the early stages of a business, investors back the team more than the idea.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no secret that professional investors, particularly VCs, don&rsquo;t like backing first time sole founders.&nbsp; They know how tough the road is and think that multiple founders will pick each other up when one loses motivation, they&rsquo;ll make better decisions and achieve more, all of which increases their chances at success.', 'Benefits of solo vs. co-founder relationships', 'Sole founder - You set the culture.

Focus on right now:</strong> William Trubridge holds the record for the deepest unassisted dive.&nbsp; He only focuses on &lsquo;right now&rsquo;, not on the much more dangerous ascent ahead.&nbsp; <br>It&rsquo;s important to keep the future in mind but, like free diving, I&rsquo;ve found the process of building Posse so challenging, with so many things to think about, that one of the hardest things is focus.&nbsp; Yet without it, everything else could fall over<br><strong>3. Developing flexibility: </strong>On the way down, one of William&rsquo;s biggest challenges is maintaining flexibility in his body, or the deep-water pressure can shatter his bones.&nbsp; I thought about where I&rsquo;ve been rigid in my thinking about how our product and team should work and what the priorities are.&nbsp; The team often push back on my structure, so I&rsquo;ll take a leaf out of William&rsquo;s book and become more flexible<br><strong>4.

Define the problem and the audience</strong> <br>We started with a hunch that some people preferred recommendations from friends to reviews from strangers on Yelp or TripAdvisor.&nbsp; <br>We continued the interview cycle until we identified four audience definers: gender, age, behaviors, and &lsquo;preferences&rsquo;.&nbsp; By this I mean, what they sought in recommendations from friends and why they enjoyed giving recommendations to friends.&nbsp; This may appear cold and calculating: breaking down users into audience segments, then designing features and artwork to appeal to those users.&nbsp; It certainly helped us understand who would want to use our product and why they&rsquo;d use it instead of the competition.<br><strong>2. Who has previously tried to solve the problem?&nbsp; Why did they succeed or fail?</strong> <br>For this exercise, we mapped out every platform, past or present that had tried to solve social search.&nbsp; Yelp and Trip Advisor obtained lots of reviews and great data but failed to get a high enough proportion of their users writing reviews to show what your friends think of places.&nbsp;&nbsp; Both sites seemed littered with irate customers writing negative reviews.&nbsp; These upset the merchants, and many users we interviewed were skeptical about who was writing the reviews.&nbsp; <br>The only platform we could find that had managed to crack the problem of persuading lots of socially connected people to give it content was Foursquare.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not saying that Foursquare, Yelp, Trip Advisor and many other local discovery platforms aren&rsquo;t great products that are loved lots of users.&nbsp; Foursquare in particular was revolutionary in the way they use game mechanics and design to make participation in their platform fun: Posse and many others since have taken inspiration from these ideas to develop other products.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m just saying, this is a process we went through: analyzing the competition to design what will hopefully be a better product for a certain part of the market that doesn&rsquo;t seem to be well-served by the existing players.<br><strong>3. Designing the principles behind our solution</strong> <br>Once we&rsquo;d defined our problem, our audience, and analyzed the competition, we created a list of principles.&nbsp; These principles underpinned the product for which the platform we designed would work.&nbsp; They included statements like: &lsquo;Our audience make recommendations to signal social status&rsquo;; &lsquo;Our audience like to collect and display their favorite things (Pinterest / Wanelo)&rsquo;; &lsquo; &lsquo;Our product category is so competitive that our product must be delightful and fun so people want to share it with friends&rsquo;; &lsquo;Our audience doesn&rsquo;t want to earn currency for making recommendations but love recognition with authentic unexpected gifts from their favorite retailers&rsquo;.&nbsp; <br><strong>4. Designing the product</strong> <br>With these principles in place, we set about designing the actual product.&nbsp; It all came together surprisingly quickly.&nbsp; The whole team took part in daily product design and we brought in lots of outside help for fresh perspectives on ideas.<br>This whole process of defining the problem and audience, analyzing the competition, designing our product principles and then the product took around four months and involved more than 200 outside interviews before the first line of code was written.', 'Ideas and process used to design a product', 'Define the problem and the audience.

And they all urge us to &lsquo;celebrate small victories&rsquo; with our teams. &nbsp; It&rsquo;s a great principle, but reality can get in the way: it&rsquo;s hard for startups to set aside time and money to celebrate wins. &nbsp;When you&rsquo;re burdened with a list of unmet goals, it&rsquo;s easy to overlook what you have achieved.<br>In the chaotic, pressure-cooker of a startup, where time and money are critical, here are five reasons for celebrating small wins.<br><strong>1. It reminds people that goal setting works.</strong> <br>I want everything to happen all at once, but accept that this isn&rsquo;t achievable. &nbsp;Our team make steady progress because every quarter we agree on a plan and set of goals. &nbsp;The goals are challenging but achievable, and when we hit them it feels great! &nbsp;Celebration underscores the success of our process.&nbsp; It motivates everyone to set and reach for the next goal.<br><strong>2. It unifies everyone around a positive outcome.</strong> <br>In a small startup team, each person is often responsible for their own department. &nbsp;On our team we have one Community Manager, one Business Development, two retail engineers, two mobile engineers, two web engineers and so on. &nbsp;We set company-wide goals but everyone contributes differently. &nbsp;Celebrating company-wide success rather than just individual achievements unifies everyone around the goal and reinforces that we&rsquo;re working on something bigger than ourselves.<br><strong>3. There&rsquo;s an opportunity to look at the big picture.</strong> <br>Celebrating provides a great moment to reflect on the big picture.&nbsp; What are we planning to achieve? &nbsp;Stopping to reflect as we reach each milestone in the journey enables the team to reflect on what&rsquo;s working, what&rsquo;s not and where we should focus our resources next.<br><strong>4. Everyone wants to be on a winning team.</strong> <br>Success is the best way to boost team morale. &nbsp;It can&rsquo;t be faked but when it&rsquo;s achieved, you should make the most of it by celebrating! &nbsp;Our engineers slogged away for months when people weren&rsquo;t using the website, and the community manager struggled to engage our audience. &nbsp;Now that we&rsquo;ve turned a corner and lots of people are using the platform, I&rsquo;ve found that the team&rsquo;s enthusiasm, creativity and productivity have exploded.<br><strong>5. It makes everyone feel appreciated.&nbsp;</strong> <br>Startup teams work much harder than regular people &ndash; well, ours does. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s vital that founders demonstrate how much they appreciate and value their team&rsquo;s contribution, and celebrating is a great way to do this.<br>I find the challenge of leading a team &ndash; keeping everyone motivated and focused in the right direction incredibly difficult. I&rsquo;ve tried everything I know to build a great culture: bringing inspirational shareholders to speak, running regular offsite events, and hosting regular team lunches are a few. &nbsp;All these help, but there&rsquo;s only one way to make a smart team happy in the long-term and that&rsquo;s progress. &nbsp;Regularly celebrating wins guarantees that progress is felt as much as possible.', '5 Reasons for celebrating small wins', 'It reminds people that goal setting works.

Get influential people talking about you before the festival.</strong> <br>In music, we focused on being heard by high profile producers: these guys are great talkers and they aren&rsquo;t pitched every day.&nbsp; For the Posse launch, we worked out which US tech influencers love SXSW and asked them to share their five favourite places to eat, drink and shop in Austin.&nbsp; We secured big names like Elspeth Rountree (NBC &amp; Fox), Maya Baratz (ABC News) and David Tisch (Boxgroup) asking them to contribute &ndash; and turned it into a &lsquo;Tech Elite&rsquo;s Guide to Austin&rsquo;.<br>We posted blogs featuring the list of a different influencer daily in the two weeks leading up to Austin, all of which were retweeted by the featured people themselves, their businesses, media and the retailers they recommended.&nbsp; <br><strong>2. Timing is everything. &nbsp;</strong> <br>Bands save releasing records until right before SXSW.&nbsp; When something awesome happens (like you release an App or secure a round of funding) don&rsquo;t write a press release straight away.&nbsp; We saved our App Launch and funding announcement so we could land a major press story right on the eve of SXSW.&nbsp; <br><strong>3. Guerrilla marketing works &ndash; but you have to be clever. &nbsp;</strong> <br>Every pole in downtown Austin is covered by 9am each morning.&nbsp; Big companies spend thousands designing and printing fancy-looking posters and then hire people to cover the poles.&nbsp; The most effective posters are simple, and if you&rsquo;re on a low budget like us, you must find a way to stand out.&nbsp; <br><strong>4. Hustle all day and all night!</strong> <br>If you come to SXSW launching anything, you have to be prepared to hustle from 7am to midnight every day. We were at all the parties we could make &ndash; if you&rsquo;re influential and you&rsquo;ve been at SXSW, there&rsquo;s a good chance we spoke to you and tried to get you to download our app.&nbsp; Opportunities were everywhere &ndash; on the first day when everyone was waiting to register, we combed through the queue meeting everyone and offering cupcakes to anyone who signed up on the spot.<br><strong>5. Get a street team</strong> <br>You can only cover so much ground by yourself.&nbsp; To maximise your impact it&rsquo;s important to try to get as many people as possible representing you at the festival.&nbsp; We chose a team of enthusiastic marketing students who did an excellent job signing up users, distributing maps and helping run our tradeshow stand.<br><strong>6. Tie yourself to other people&rsquo;s events</strong> <br>The key trick of SXSW for a band is to get on the bill at an event where everyone is going to be.&nbsp; If you try to put on your own show, you have the near-impossible job of promoting the show to a large group of people you don&rsquo;t know and who already have a plan of events they want to go to.', 'Six tricks to launch a startup in a conference', 'Get influential people talking about you before the festival.

The most important thing to look for in a start-up team member is the ability to <strong>MAKE THINGS HAPPEN</strong>.&nbsp; In a corporate or less intense environment, it&rsquo;s okay to set a bunch of targets and then come up with a list of reasons why something wasn&rsquo;t possible. In a start-up there are two meaningful outcomes: success and failure.&nbsp; The ability to make things happen has nothing to do with intelligence &ndash; I&rsquo;ve found that even the smartest people procrastinate or buckle under pressure.&nbsp; So when you&rsquo;re hiring, always look for examples of times in the past where they had an ambitious challenge and overcame barriers to achieve.<br>2. The next thing to look for is creativity and intelligence.&nbsp; As the founder, you always think your ideas are brilliant &ndash; if you didn&rsquo;t then you never would have started this crazy thing.&nbsp; I soon learned that my first ideas are often wrong and it&rsquo;s important to surround yourself with people who are passionate about your product, smart and creative.&nbsp; The whole team works together to strategise major business challenges and design the product.&nbsp; More importantly, each member of a start-up runs their own department <br>3. Hire slowly and methodically.&nbsp;Check references!&nbsp; I know everyone says to do this but it&rsquo;s easy to get excited about someone and forget.&nbsp; Then when they don&rsquo;t work out everyone asks me what their references said, and it&rsquo;s embarrassing to admit I didn&rsquo;t check.&nbsp; Ask lots of different people to interview a prospective new team member; obtain a range of perspectives.&nbsp; By giving a protective hire a list of questions and evaluating how they approach the answers you can see how creative and smart they are, and you also discover if they have a problem getting things done on time.<br>4. When you do make a mistake (and you will) act fast.&nbsp; If someone is not right for us I generally can tell in the first few weeks, and have been pretty good at acting quickly.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s always a morale-breaker when the team loses a member but you can&rsquo;t afford to have an underperforming person hanging around, bringing down the standard.<br>I&rsquo;m happy to report that we now have one of the most passionate, creative, smart and productive start-up teams around.&nbsp; A start-up is a mission though a jungle.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t want people who&rsquo;ll sit around hypothesising &ndash; you want warriors who&rsquo;ll get out there and try things.&nbsp; People whose drive and ambition will overcome anything.', 'Recruiting lessons for a start up', 'The most important thing to look for in a start-up team member is the ability to MAKE THINGS HAPPEN.

Listen to everyone.</strong>&nbsp; As a founder, you&rsquo;re naturally optimistic and you believe you&rsquo;re on-track to build a hugely successful company.&nbsp; If you didn&rsquo;t have a high level of self-belief then you&rsquo;d never be able to convince others to invest in your idea or join your team.&nbsp; Balance this optimism with a passion to constantly test your plans and product with users.&nbsp; Not just the initial model hypothesises but every single thing you do should be thoroughly tested before, during and after it&rsquo;s implemented.&nbsp; <br><strong>2. Take time out to think</strong>.&nbsp; After I&rsquo;ve listened to as many people as I can, including users, team members, board directors and my friends, I&rsquo;ll sneak away and spend time by myself to think.&nbsp; Through this, I can build a strategy.&nbsp; Once I have the strategy worked out, I take it back out to the team and test the ideas.&nbsp; If the strategy is good, everyone gets excited; if it&rsquo;s bad, everyone argues.&nbsp; <br><strong>3. Face big problems head on.</strong>&nbsp; One of my mentors in music gave me some great business advice once.&nbsp; &lsquo;If you think there&rsquo;s a problem &ndash; there&rsquo;s a problem.&rsquo;&nbsp; As the entrepreneur, you live and breathe the company, you can sense when something isn&rsquo;t working.&nbsp; Many startups that I&rsquo;ve seen fail, knew they had the problem that killed them long before they died.&nbsp; I think you have to tackle every major problem head on in the next spin of your management loop.<br><strong>4. Move fast.&nbsp;</strong> It&rsquo;s obvious that with limited time and resources you have a certain number of spins to get the product &ndash; market fit right.&nbsp; We still don&rsquo;t have ours 100% there, although our user engagement metrics suggest we&rsquo;re coming much closer.&nbsp; The faster you can create good new strategy, implement and test, the better your chances are of success.<br><strong>5. Be disciplined:&nbsp;</strong> It&rsquo;s so easy to want to react to every small problem, fix every bug and make lots of incremental improvements.&nbsp; Earlier this year we were sucked into addressing all of these as they came up.&nbsp; Weeks passed by without any major advances in the implementation of a strategy, so we&rsquo;ve learnt as a team to focus on getting out the big important things that we can learn from rather than making sure the site is perfect.', 'Making the feedback loop spin effectively', 'Listen to everyone.

Design agency:&nbsp;</strong>To find a design agency to work with, I started by asking a bunch of friends who work in the creative industries for references. &nbsp;I checked out about twelve agencies online, then met with four. &nbsp;We ended up selecting <strong>&lsquo;</strong><a href="http://universalfavourite.com.au/" target="_blank">Universal Favourite</a><strong>&lsquo; </strong>for a few reasons. &nbsp;Firstly, we love their work; the amount of effort they&rsquo;d applied to the pitching process; they were highly recommended by people I trust (very important); their office is within three minutes walk of ours, and we had good chemistry.&nbsp; <br><strong>2. Accountant:&nbsp;</strong> I chose David Kenny at &lsquo;<a href="http://www.hallchadwick.com.au/" target="_blank"><strong>Hall Chadwick</strong></a><strong>&lsquo;</strong> because: he came highly&nbsp;recommended; he knew a lot about the startup world, how to structure an employee share plan, structuring fundraising documents and suchlike; he understood another key part of the startup world &ndash; we can&rsquo;t afford to pay much at this stage.&nbsp; And I&nbsp;liked and trusted him as a person.<br>The next challenge is how best to manage a supplier &ndash; this is where the real art happens. &nbsp;From the fiery lessons of trial and error, here are my top three tips for startups that need to manage suppliers.<br><strong>1. Agree a quote upfront.&nbsp; This should include a table of dates and deliverables</strong>. &nbsp;Be clear that any diversions from the agreed quote must be agreed in writing before anyone incurs additional expenses. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s also important to make sure you&rsquo;ve got a way out or to pause the agreement if your circumstances change or if you&rsquo;re not happy with the supplier&rsquo;s work. <br><strong>2. Deal with issues head on.</strong> &nbsp;When you sense a problem with dates, a budget, or if the work isn&rsquo;t good then deal with it straight away. &nbsp;Sit down with the partner, try to understand the root causes of the problem and come up with a solution together. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s important to be polite and always try to keep the relationship intact. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s likely you&rsquo;ve committed to a budget, so if you want to exit gracefully without being stung for the entire bill, you&rsquo;ll need to be friendly. &nbsp;<br><strong>3. Treat suppliers like team members &ndash; they need love too.</strong> &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll get more out of your suppliers if you focus on what motivates them. &nbsp;Make sure they feel part of something exciting and important.&nbsp; Invite them into your office as much as possible and try to get their office to feel like an extension of your brand. &nbsp;Supply partners love public credit because it helps them win more clients &ndash; try to promote their involvement in your success as much as you can through your website, presentations and so on.', 'How to select and manage suppliers', 'Select - Ask for references, effort applied to pitching process, trusted.

Winning people over. &nbsp;</strong> <br>Whether you need to raise investment money, recruit team members or gain customers &ndash; every entrepreneur needs to have or acquire the ability to win people over.<br>In music, I learned that the biggest opportunities didn&rsquo;t always go to the best artists. &nbsp;<strong>It was about the number and credibility of the people who wanted to be involved, the momentum of the project and the excitement about the future.</strong><br>It&rsquo;s the same in tech.&nbsp; <strong>It&rsquo;s all about the team, our momentum and inspiring the person to share our vision.&nbsp;</strong> Winning people over is an art and it&rsquo;s critical to all aspects of business.<br><strong>2. Creativity. &nbsp;</strong> <br>Entrepreneurs see everyday problems and dream about solutions.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re interested in people, ask probing questions about the way they do things now and jump to ideas of how to make things simpler, faster, better or more fun.<br>Being passionate about continuous creativity is an essential quality of successful entrepreneur.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s rare that the first idea is bang on and if you can&rsquo;t innovate then you&rsquo;re dead!<br><strong>3. Tenacity. </strong> <br>I would say this is my personal biggest strength. &nbsp;Someone recently asked me if I thought I was tough to which I replied, &lsquo;no, but I&rsquo;m tenacious.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m like a cockroach &ndash; you can&rsquo;t kill me!&rsquo;<br>Throughout life I&rsquo;ve started and run quite a few major projects. &nbsp;None of them has been easy; I can name times in all of them when things looked grim and I thought I&rsquo;d fail and lose lots of money. &nbsp;But each time I stuck at it and every time things worked out well , knowing that I''ll never give up gives me a lot of confidence that we&rsquo;ll make it.<br>These are my three strengths and I think they&rsquo;re all you need to be successful. &nbsp;So long as you can keep bringing onboard great people, keep winning customers, keep raising money, keep innovating and keep going.', 'The strenghts you need to be successful', 'Winning people over.

It makes teams work. </strong>&nbsp;At the start of each month, I share the company&rsquo;s financial position.&nbsp; Although unnerving at first, I find that complete transparency creates a real sense of camaraderie among the team.&nbsp; Everyone understands how their work contributes to the company&rsquo;s goals, and the reasoning behind decisions to focus on various aspects of the product, user growth, PR or fundraising.&nbsp; It also allows me to get feedback on key business decisions which is helpful when you&rsquo;ve got a team as smart as ours and I sense it gives everyone a sense of security as there&rsquo;s no unresolved questions or gossip about what might be happening.<br><strong>2. People get behind you.</strong>&nbsp; When I posted the &lsquo;<a href="http://www.rebekahcampbell.com/2012/06/12/redesigning-our-strategy/" target="_blank" title="Redesigning our strategy">Redesigning our strategy</a>&lsquo; and &lsquo;<a href="http://www.rebekahcampbell.com/2012/06/26/this-is-really-hard/" target="_blank" title="This is really hard!">This is really hard</a>&lsquo; blogs, I didn&rsquo;t know how people would react.&nbsp; I thought some might laugh at my novice mistakes, but I was wrong.&nbsp; Loads of users signed up as a result of those posts, and I was overwhelmed by the volume of feedback and suggestions emailed to me in the days following.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve found that, by being open with our users about our vision, what we&rsquo;re learning and what we plan to do next, we&rsquo;re inviting them to join our journey.&nbsp; Users can become a part of the process of building this great platform.&nbsp; This helps get people behind you and it also helps to have lots of feedback and ideas to draw on.<br><strong>3. You&rsquo;ll have more energy. </strong>&nbsp;If you run the City To Surf, you&rsquo;ll know how, at the start, everyone looks great in their flash Sydney running gear and fake tans, but there&rsquo;s a point where you&rsquo;re exhausted trying to slog up the hill, you grunt, splash water on your face, and no longer care what anyone thinks about you.&nbsp; Running a startup is like this all the time!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s hard work and sometimes downright draining.&nbsp; It takes energy to maintain the appearance of perfection: give it up and you&rsquo;re lighter and happier!<br><strong>4. It helps everyone else learn.</strong>&nbsp; If record company execs, managers and promoters would talk openly and publicly about their challenges and failures then they could work together to solve problems and it would save making so many of the same mistakes over and over.&nbsp; Thankfully the startup industry is completely different.&nbsp; Failure is applauded &ndash; almost too much &ndash; and there&rsquo;s a community of events, groups and media that encourages us all to share what we&rsquo;re learning.&nbsp; Startup teams and their products are evolving faster and as a result everyone is more likely to succeed and the world will get higher quality new products to experience.<br>The more open you are the more likely you&rsquo;ll get the advice you need from team members, users and the startup community at large.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll take people with you on a journey and if nothing else, being candid requires a lot less energy than being guarded!', 'Four awesome things about transparency', 'It makes teams work.

Accept mistakes as part of the process.</strong>&nbsp; There is no point getting frustrated and losing sleep when things don&rsquo;t work.&nbsp; Building a new product is a process and we don&rsquo;t know how long it will take to get things right.&nbsp; But<br><strong>2. Encourage the team to work fast. </strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;This is tough because great people want to be proud of their work.&nbsp; We have an awesome team of engineers who like to test everything thoroughly (as they should) but in our case it&rsquo;s more important to get the feedback loop spinning fast so we can learn and iterate than it is to produce perfect code with no bugs.&nbsp; Although we&rsquo;ve got no idea how long it will take to get the product right, we do have a limited amount of money and time, so moving fast is imperative.<br><strong>3. Focus on things that move the needle.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone wants to fix the things that annoy them most, however these may not be the items that make the biggest impact on users.&nbsp; With time pressure and limited resource it&rsquo;s vital that every team member is focused on the things that make the biggest impact to improving the product.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;m confident everyone is working to capacity and working on the right things &ndash; but it&rsquo;s still difficult when we know there are so many other things we just can&rsquo;t get to yet.<br><strong>4. Test and measure everything.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve mentioned before that I&rsquo;m obsessed with talking to users, watching user tests and checking the analytics of our product.&nbsp; Equally, if not more important than testing and measuring a product, is talking to users and asking them open ended questions about themselves, the product and how it fits into their lives.&nbsp; I try to do two sessions per week with users and spend the first hour just asking general questions before we even look at the product.&nbsp; They won&rsquo;t tell you what they want, but an insight comes from every session that helps shape the future of the product.<br><strong>5. Meditate.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; I learnt to meditate several years ago and I started practising again twice per day.&nbsp; I went back to yoga.&nbsp; At first, all the problems with our site streamed through my head like a freight train.&nbsp; Remarkably, it only took a few days to return to normal.&nbsp; Everyone has their own methods of stress relief, yoga and meditation are mine and they&rsquo;re always the first things to go when I feel under pressure.', 'Techniques to develop steady progress', 'Accept mistakes as part of the process.

When these experiments slow down or stall out, it&rsquo;s often due to well-meaning people who don&rsquo;t understand the nature of early product development.<br/> As you&rsquo;re building and developing your innovative product, watch out for these speedbumps along your path.<br/><strong>Speedbump #1: The Mass Market Visionary</strong><br/>Mass Market Visionaries are focused on where their product is headed, and what it could beÃ¢â‚¬Å Ã¢â‚¬â€?Ã¢â‚¬Å not where it is RIGHT NOW. They&rsquo;re uncomfortable focusing on a small early market of customers who don&rsquo;t necessarily fit their big vision of a mass-market product.<br/> Problem isÃ¢â‚¬Å Ã¢â‚¬â€?Ã¢â‚¬Å if you&rsquo;re building something innovative and you don&rsquo;t capture and delight your micro-vertical, you won&rsquo;t get the chance to HAVE a mass market to worry about.<br/> If your product is mainstream-friendly and easy to understand, go ahead and target the masses. But if you&rsquo;re building something innovative,<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_lifecycle" target="_blank">mainstream consumers won&rsquo;t be able to understand or value your creation</a>Ã¢â‚¬Å Ã¢â‚¬â€?Ã¢â‚¬Å or give you the feedback you need to evolve.<br/><strong>Speedbump #2: The Passionate Believer</strong><br/>It takes superhuman self-control to listen dispassionately while early customers rip apart your beloved ideas. Entrepreneurs who believe deeply in their idea will be sorely tempted to focus on results that confirm their beliefs.<br/> Passionate Believers tend to dismiss or derail customer insights that don&rsquo;t support the outcome they want to see. Sometimes they&rsquo;ll partner up with Data Nazis (see below) to bolster their case for ignoring the results of subjective customer research.<br/> The simplest way to manage this is to remove the entrepreneur from the face-to-face customer interviews. Instead, have a dispassionate third party (internal or external) collect the data.<br/><strong>Speedbump #3: The Data Nazi</strong><br/>Some people worship at the altar of Analytics, and believe that actionable research ALWAYS involves A/B testing and thousands of data points. That&rsquo;s great if you&rsquo;re optimizing an existing product, but a total FAIL for bringing something new and innovative to life.<br/> Data Nazis don&rsquo;t have much hands-on experience bringing innovative products to life. They set themselves up as the champions of TRUTH, and dismiss any qualitative research as &ldquo;unscientific&rdquo; to push their own agenda.<br/> Innovation comes from iterative prototyping and testing. Analytics come later. Know when to use both.<br/><strong>Speedbump #4: The Cautious Thinker</strong><br/>Every successful, high-performing MVP team I&rsquo;ve worked with is empowered to do fast, iterative decision-making. If your team is weighed down by fearful, cautious thinkers, your speed and agility will be severely hampered.<br/> The most effective MVP teams make lots of small, revocable decisions to keep moving Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and use Lean tactics to recover quickly and learn from mistakes.<br/> <strong>&nbsp;Speedbump #5: The High-Gloss Champion</strong><br/> Whenever I see entrepreneurs focus on polished visuals before working out their core activities and systems, my confidence in their success plummets. Visual quality is important at some stages of product developmentÃ¢â‚¬Å Ã¢â‚¬â€?Ã¢â‚¬Å you don&rsquo;t want to ship an ugly, hard-to-use product.<br/> During the fast-iteration stages of early customer discovery, focusing on polished visuals is a major speedbump. High-gloss champions are deeply attached to polished visuals, and have a hard time imagining how sketches and wireframes might evolve into something wonderful. These same people can be fooled by hi-res visuals into thinking something is further along than it is (AKA &ldquo;The Clinkle Effect&rdquo;).', 'The people to avoid when building and developing your innovative product', 'The Mass Market Visionary.

Here&nbsp;are the 3 most common MVP mistakes I see startups make that can cripple their team.<br/> <strong>Mistake #1: Lusting after&nbsp;hi-res visuals too early</strong> <br/> There''s a certain type of person&nbsp;who cannot grasp a product concept with sketches - they need to see something that looks finished. &nbsp;These same people are often fooled by hi-res visuals - they think something&nbsp;is&nbsp;further along&nbsp;than it&nbsp;actually is. Let''s call it &quot;The Clinkle Effect.&quot;&nbsp; <br/> LESSON: Don''t fall prey to The Clinkle&nbsp;Effect. Try not to&nbsp;slow down your team by lusting after - and investing in - hi-res visuals too early. Instead, focus on&nbsp;building&nbsp;a low-res, high-value, easy-to-update prototype for your MVP &nbsp;- it will setup the right incentives to maximize your team''s learning.<br/> <strong>Mistake #2:&nbsp;Dismissing Tester Feedback</strong> <br/> These days, many<br>of us worship at the alter of analytics - which are great for many situations, but not all. When you''re doing&nbsp;early MVP design and testing, you''re collecting subjective responses and looking for patterns and &quot;hot spots&quot; of excitement. If you''ve got the right testers, you only need a handful to know if you''re on the right track.<br/> LESSON: The best&nbsp;designs come out of iterative prototyping and testing. Analytics come later. Know when to use both powerful tools.<br/> <strong>Mistake #3: Selective&nbsp;Listening</strong> <br/> As an entrepreneur, it''s very hard to listen objectively and hear criticism of your great&nbsp;ideas. But if you''re committed to building something people want and need, customer&nbsp;feedback is a gold mine.<br/> LESSON: Listen objectively,&nbsp;like a scientist, for the key message your customers are communicating&nbsp;- even (or especially) if it challenges your core assumptions.', 'The most common MVP mistakes startups make that can cripple their team', 'Lusting after hi-res visuals too early.

Great onboarding invites you in,&nbsp;shows you the ropes, and helps you accomplish something you care about. It makes you feel smart, empowered, curious, and ready for more. Here are 5 design rules for tightening your funnel and turning newcomers into regulars.<br/> <strong>1. Clarify your Message and Value Prop</strong> <br/> It all starts during Discovery - when people first hear about your product through a friend, or via social media or advertising. That''s when initial expectations are set - they''ll either be attracted or repelled. Strong, clear messaging about your core experience and value&nbsp;prop are vitally important at this stage. <br/> When discovery happens through word of mouth, your &nbsp;customers will express their own take on your value prop. That''s good news - IF your product delivers on it''s promises.&nbsp;<br/> <strong>2. Welcome Newcomers and Set Expectations</strong> <br/> When someone moves through Discovery and starts playing, they''re setting out on their own personal&nbsp;learning path. If&nbsp;you want them to become happy and engaged, acknowledge them and&nbsp;give them a clear and compelling sense of what''s to come.<br/> How you do this, of course, depends on your product, positioning, audience, and most of all your onboarding goals. Great onboarding can be brief and to the point, if that''s what the product is all about. <br/> <strong>3. Help players customize their learning level and style&nbsp;</strong> <br/> At the beginning of onboarding, Lumosity asks you to personalize your brain fitness goals along five dimensions - and uses your&nbsp;answers to customize your training program (<em>at least in appearance - I couldn''t tell if the info was actually used).&nbsp;</em><br/> Contrast that with Duolingo, which lets players choose a language,&nbsp;decide whether or not to set a goal, and start playing &nbsp;- with the option to test out of content if they have the proficiency. <br/> <strong>4. Provide Lightweight Activities That Build Investment</strong> <br/> The best way to learn is to DO - with appropriate constraints, coaching and tips along the way. Great onboarding &nbsp;quickly engages players in activities that help them learn the ropes and invest in the experience. &nbsp;During onboarding, Lumosity offers short, varied games that target different brain functions. This visual creates a powerful urge to see those skills improve - and thus an effective incentive to sign up for training.<br/> <strong>5. Show visible progress towards meaningful goals</strong> <br/> People don''t like to feel coerced; they want&nbsp;to see progress towards goals they''ve chosen; they''re&nbsp;intrinsically motivated to get better at something that matters. <br/> Great onboarding feels like making progress towards something you care about. &nbsp;Ask yourself: &nbsp;why are my players here? what are their goals - both short-term, and long-term? What do they want to learn and master? Think about how you can weave those goals and aspirations into your progression system.<br/> One straightforward approach is to ask players directly about their goals, then track and display progress against those goals.', 'Design rules for tightening your funnel and turning newcomers into regulars', 'Clarify your Message and Value Prop.

Why is that?&nbsp;How&nbsp;do digital services&nbsp;entice us back, over and over again? What does it&nbsp;take to turn a one-time experience into a habit?<br/> For each of us, the&nbsp;answer is deeply personal. We become habitual users of games, apps and services when they hit that singular &quot;sweet spot&quot; of opportunity, need fulfillment and social context.&nbsp;My son, for example,&nbsp;NEEDED to be on Myspace, then Facebook - and now Snapchat. His daily habits were formed - &nbsp;then broken &amp; re-formed - as his tribe migrated.<br/> Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Minecraft, Candy Crush, Clash of Clans -&nbsp;all these&nbsp;habit-forming systems are built around&nbsp;a&nbsp;compelling feedback loop with a&nbsp;pleasurable, repeatable activity at it''s core. &nbsp;These&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/MichailKatkoff/20131024/203142/MidCore_Success_Part_1_Core_Loops.php" target="_blank" title="Clash of Clans: Core Game Loops">Core Loops</a> (AKA Game Loops, Compulsion Loops, Habit Loops, Activity Loops, Engagement Loops) are widely used in gaming and elsewhere to model players'' action chains and&nbsp;in-game progression.<br/> A well-crafted Core&nbsp;Loop&nbsp;is&nbsp;essential for&nbsp;great gameplay - and in sophisticated games, these loop systems can&nbsp;get quite complex. For example,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/MichailKatkoff/20131024/203142/MidCore_Success_Part_1_Core_Loops.php" target="_blank" title="Core Loops">this excellent analysis of Clash of Clans</a> illustrates how core loops, double loops, nested loops, and micro-loops that&nbsp;all work together to make that game so compelling to play.

Here are 5 tips to help super-change your interviews with actionable insights.<br/> <strong>Do a pre-interview Screening Survey to&nbsp;collect basic data&nbsp;</strong><br/> Don''t waste precious interview time collecting simple-to-answer&nbsp;basic info. Instead, create a pre-interview Screening Survey to learn basic data upfront about your potential subjects. For best results, embed this survey into your recruiting efforts. Include&nbsp;questions about their age, occupation, tech habits, favorite media sources, etc in this survey - along with any qualifying questions that will help you filter their need and readiness for your product. <br/> <strong>Ask questions that illuminate habits, needs, pain points, and triggers</strong><br/> A good interview script asks question that illuminate the habits, emotions and triggers embedded in people''s daly lives. What is their day like? What activities do they do regularly - and at what time? &nbsp;Who do they interact with and care about? What do they long for - what''s missing in their lives? What''s causing them friction and frustration? What are they tired of and eager to change? What elicits a strong emotional reaction? <br/> <strong>Tweak your interview script to focus on useful and revealing questions</strong><br/> This&nbsp;is guerrilla-style customer development, not a controlled scientific experiment.&nbsp;If you do 15 screening interviews, after the first few you''ll likely &nbsp;notice patterns, and start learning which questions are working and which are not. Go ahead and edit your script between interviews to remove questions that aren''t yielding good info, expand on ones that are, and add new questions to drill down on emerging themes.&nbsp;Identify emerging patterns early and formulate as mini-hypotheses.&nbsp;<br/> <strong>Keep an eye out for existing habits to piggyback on</strong><br/> Creating brand new habits is tough. It''s so much easier to piggyback on an existing habit. For that reason, as you''re conducting your interviews, listen closely for existing habits that might serve as &quot;hooks&quot; for your offering. <br/> <strong>Keep calm, unbiased and dispassionate during the interviews</strong><br/> One of the hardest things for a passionate product creator to do is <a href="http://www.eleganthack.com/lean-is-listening/" target="_blank">watch people react to their product and challenge their core beliefs</a>. That''s why you need someone who''s not emotionally invested in the product to conduct the interviews - ideally a trained researcher, but in practice anyone who listens well and can record what they see and hear without influencing the results. &nbsp; The interviewer''s demeanor needs be calm, unbiased and dispassionate - and sometimes that means handing over the reins.', '5 Tips to help super-change your interviews', 'Do a pre-interview Screening Survey to collect basic data.

I&nbsp;affectionately call this Operation Find &amp; Delight.<br/> <strong>Step 1: clarify your product/business goals and constraints</strong> <br/> Take a look at your product vision, business focus, revenue model and team skillset. What audience or demographic are you best setup to serve? What are the technical and/or access requirements for using your product - especially early on? &nbsp;Who do you NOT want to serve for regulation, liability or revenue reasons?<br/> <strong>Step 2: Create a testable Microvertical Hypothesis</strong> <br/> Once you''ve clarified your goals, ruled out certain audiences and broadly focused on who you''re serving, it''s time get specific. Given the market space, tech platform and audience you&rsquo;re targeting, ask yourself: who NEEDS your product the most and is likely and able to use it? &nbsp;Who&rsquo;s already doing something similar - or using similar products? Who would find it life-changing in a meaningful way?<br/> Your job is to create a description of a PERSON OR GROUP OF PEOPLE who you think are likely to be valuable early enthusiasts. &nbsp;In this description, include details that are relevant to when and how they''ll use your product, such as technology platform, behavior patterns, use of existing services,, etc.<br/> <strong>Step 3: &nbsp;Test and refine your Hypothesis with customer research&nbsp;</strong> <br/> Now that you&rsquo;ve generated your Microvertical Hypothesis, it''s time to recruit people who fit that profile and test your value prop with subjective research methods like surveys, interviews, and field studies.<br/> You can kickstart this process by doing Screening Interviews, a guerilla-style research technique that can quickly and iteratively help you identify&nbsp;your Microvertical. Heres how it works:<ul type="disc"> <li>Use your MicroVertical Hypothesis to recruit 15-20 subjects for paid research (which come at a later stage)</li><li>Conduct 15-minute screening interviews to learn about their lifestyle, habits and attitudes relating to your product&nbsp;(I''ll write a separate post about how to construct effective screening interview questions)</li><li>Summarize the patterns you''re seeing, and how those patterns support or challenge your hypothesis</li><li>After you''ve completed the screening interviews, select a subset for paid research, based on feedback&nbsp;quality and &nbsp;&quot;fit&quot; with your value prop, business model, and schedule.</li></ul><strong>Step 4: &nbsp;Update and circulate your validated Hypothesis within the team</strong> <br/> The purpose of Customer Development is to focus the entire team on building things that people actually want. It''s important to keep your&nbsp;team in the loop as you''re doing &nbsp;early research.<br/> You can inform the team about your intial Hypothesis, collect their input, do &nbsp;Customer Development research, and then cycle back with the team and communicate the research results as a set of changes and/or confirmations to your Hypothesis.<br/> <strong>Step 5: Build an ongoing Microvertical feedback loop and private community</strong> <br/> As a product creator, one of the most powerful resources you can develop is a network of pre-qualified players who can give you early feedback on new features &amp; systems. Recruiting and vetting people takes time and effort upfront - so once you&rsquo;ve identified them, it''s smart to keep that relationship alive and reap the benefits of play-testing with known players throughout your MVP process and beyond.<br/> A connected community of early adopters can dramatically increase your chance of successfully launching innovation.', '5-step plan for finding early adopters who can help you bring your project to life', 'Clarify your product/business goals and constraints.

In&nbsp;the spirit of lessons learned, here are<strong> 7 Habits of Highly Successful MVP teams.</strong><br/> <strong>Habit #1: They collect validated knowledge about players'' unmet needs, pain points and secret desires</strong> <br/> This is&nbsp;customer development through a game design lens: you need to build something people want and need - AND create a compelling, useable experience that keeps people playing. &nbsp;You''re not designing for everyone - you''re designing for specific people and use cases. Successful MVP teams IDENTIFY their target players, LISTEN and LEARN proactively, CREATE sketches/prototypes that capture the essence of the product idea, and TEST their ideas on target players so they can continue iterating.<br/> <strong>Habit #2: They identify and leverage a &nbsp;Microvertical of early enthusiasts</strong> <br/> Every successful innovative product has an early group of enthusiasts who discover it and make it their own. Most successful online games all found an early, enthusiastic group of participants who helped to kickstart the system towards growth.<br/> Think of this group as your Microvertical - the first wave of people who LOVE and NEED your product, and will evangelize it out of sheer enthusiasm. Who are these people? What do they have in common? The sooner you find and start connecting with your Microvertical, &nbsp;the sooner you&rsquo;ll be on your path towards building something people really want and need.<br/> <strong>Habit #3: They understand and piggyback on people''s existing daily habits</strong> <br/> If you understand the&nbsp;daily habits of your target players, you can increase your chances of success by designing your experience to extend and enhance those habits. &nbsp;Existing habits are something you can look for and learn about during&nbsp;Customer Development interviews and early user testing.<br/> <strong>Habit #4: They playtest their experience with real customers early and often</strong> <br/> Play-testing your idea in sketch/prototype form is how you validate assumptions and&nbsp;test your product hypothesis. The Lean Startup movement popularized the idea of iterative playtesting, and has spawned great ideas for getting &ldquo;Lean Feedback&rdquo; like <a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/11/using-adwords-to-assess-demand-for-your.html" target="_blank">fake landing pages and adwords campaigns. </a>&nbsp;In game development, iterative playtesting with real players is business-as-usual - it&rsquo;s how great games get built.<br/> Showing early sketches and mockups to real customers would have saved that company weeks of UX and engineering work.<br/> <strong>Habit #5: They create and maintain a Player Advisory Group for ongoing feedback</strong> <br/> As a product creator, one of the most powerful resources you can develop is a network of pre-qualified players who can give you early feedback on new features &amp; systems - <a href="http://puppetlabs.com/community/puppet-test-pilots-program" target="_blank">like this one</a>. Recruiting and vetting players takes time and effort upfront - so once you&rsquo;ve identified people who can give you good feedback, it''s smart to&nbsp;keep that relationship alive and reap the benefits of play-testing throughout your product lifecycle.<br/> <strong>Habit #6: They bring their core systems to life before polishing visuals</strong> <br/> The best product teams I&rsquo;ve worked with understand how to bring systems to life with minimal production values. &nbsp;When I see an entrepreneur focus on polishing visuals before working out and tuning their basic activities and systems, my confidence in their success plummets. Smart MVP teams know how to create &ldquo;just enough&rdquo; visuals to test and tune their experience. They do this by finding and leveraging early enthusiasts who can see beyond the visuals and engage with the basic experience over time. <br/> You don''t want to ship with an UGLY product - but don''t let polished visuals seduce you into thinking you''re further along than you are.<br/> <strong>Habit #7: Enable enthusiasts to go deep, develop expertise, and build status</strong> <br/> Most successful games develop a following of hardcore players who want to feel like they''re part of the development cycle. These players don''t represent the mass audience for that game - they''re the enthusiasts, &nbsp;experts, &nbsp;university students, miltary wives, wanna-be devs. The gaming Microvertical.<br/> Among YOUR Microvertical, there will likely be some enthusiastic players who want to go deep - to master your systems, offer their product ideas, &nbsp;test out new features, peek behind the scenes, earn status and become know in the community. Smart MVP Teams find a way to say YES to these people and co-opt their energy and enthusiasm. &nbsp;You can start simple by providing feedback forums and engaging with people right from the start. As you product evolves past the MVP stage, you can add expert-specific features and systems (when appropriate) to cater to your enthusiasts, leverage their knowledge, and keep them engaged in your product.', 'The practices of Successful MVP Teams', 'They collect validated knowledge about players'' unmet needs, pain points and secret desires.

To mesh smoothly with &nbsp;Lean Startup practices, I''ve added another dimension to the PJF called &nbsp;&quot;The Developer''s Journey&quot; - AKA how you refine and grow your MVP over time. This tells you WHERE to focus your efforts early-on, WHICH elements to flesh out and test first (and delay for later) and HOW to scale and expand on your initial success.&nbsp;<br/> As you''re bringing your product to life via Lean Startup practices, where do you put your focus?<br/> <strong>1. Start by developing&nbsp;your Habit Loop.</strong><br/> The purpose of your MVP is to test&nbsp;your core assumptions and better understand&nbsp;the needs, habits and desires of your core audience AKA micro-vertical.<br>Early-on, , focus&nbsp;on testing and tweaking your Habit Loop -<br>AKA &nbsp;game loop, engagement loop, compulsion loop, core loop. Look&nbsp;for the &quot;hook&quot; that gets people coming back regularly - ideally, coming back daily. &nbsp; <br/> <strong>2. When you''re ready to scale into Beta,&nbsp;refine your Onboarding</strong> <br/> Once you''ve identified a core Habit Loop, you''re in a good position to design an effective onboarding system - which will allow you to scale to a larger, less &quot;insider&quot; audience. As you build &nbsp;and run your Beta you''ll want to develop, test and tweak your Onboarding mechanics as you continue to develop and refine your Habit Loop.<br/> <strong>3. Plant the seeds for Mastery - then co-develop your systems with passionate players.</strong><br/> The role of Mastery is an oft-misunderstood piece of this puzzle. Mastery is tied up with learning, competence, and skill. What makes your system engaging to master? What skill is the player learning? &nbsp;How is mastery communicated and celebrated?&nbsp;How does your system shape, constrain and enable social interaction? &nbsp;Does the system encourage people to compare themselves to others? Does it enable battles and contests? Does it setup people to join forces in service of a greater cause?<br/> If you aspire to build a game-like system, think early about what skill your players will be developing and mastering. Then ask yourself: &nbsp;how can our most skilled and passionate players&nbsp;contribute to the system - and the community? What enhanced role and powers could they earn? &nbsp;But when it comes to creating earned roles and powers for expert players, you''ll be most successful if you take your cues from the needs, habits and desires of your core enthusiasts.', 'How you refine and grow your MVP over time', 'Start by developing  your Habit Loop.

I''ve been digging into the scientific literature on positive psychology and neuroscience correlates, and learning about the activities the reliably make people happier</a>. I''d like to share 3 key things I''ve learned from this journey.<br/> <strong>1) Investing in Meaningful Relationships makes people happier</strong> <br/> There&nbsp;are a variety of regular practices - &nbsp;including gratitude, kindness, mindfulness, and empathy - that have been shown to improve happiness in clinical trials. However, the most robust and widely-cited finding is the impact of relationships on happiness. In a nutshell, people who cultivate meaningful relationships report higher levels of happiness. <br/> <strong>2) Social Comparison makes people unhappier</strong> <br/> In the age of Gamification Everywhere, social comparison has become a default technique for motivating and engaging people. But happiness science reveals that judging yourself in relation to others is a mental habit that leads to envy, guilt, regret, and defensiveness</a>.&nbsp;Once you start comparing yourself to others, you''ve jumped onto a treadmill that never stops - there is ALWAYS someone else who is smarter/better/stronger/richer/more beautiful/more popular than you are.<br/> <strong>3) Happiness is a Habit -&nbsp;you CAN change the way you think and perceive the world</strong> <br/> Since my academic background, I''m familiar with the research on brain plasticity - which boils down to <em>You Are What You Think</em>. &nbsp;Brains turn out to be highly programmable - within<em>&nbsp;</em>certain limits,&nbsp;you can literally rewire your brain and stimulate growth and change through specific mental activities.<br/> There are a collection of well-researched techniques or &quot;interventions&quot; for developing a positive life outlook and generating feelings of happiness and well-being.

As anyone who talks to me knows, it is, I feel, the only way forward in a corporate (and wider) world of constant change, fear and uncertainty; and engaging fully as leaders and business owners is essential to success.<br>But letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s be realistic. As we discussed just this last week at LBDG Exclusive Dinners, to err is human Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and sometimes, collaborative experiences simply donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work out, whether on a large scale or small.<br><em>So what should we do if collabora-will</em> <em>turns into collabora-wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t?</em><br><em>Say Ã¢â‚¬Ëœwell, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s obviously not the way to do business Ã¢â‚¬â€œ IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m going back to the closed door and me, myself and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢?</em>Absolutely not.<br>If you have a setback, learn from it. Take the following realisations and apply them to your business area, company or enterprise:<br><br><ul type="disc"><li><strong>Did this fail because of a friendship: </strong>did you go into commercial collaboration with a friend or family member, without thoroughly considering all this would entail? Did you make clear delineations in terms of financing, areas of responsibility, and have it all signed and sealed? This is not an occasion to be Ã¢â‚¬ËœfluidÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Be clear about who is doing what, and paying for it. And when you have to have the tough conversations, have them. If you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, then you will definitely lose the personal relationship. Be prepared to step up, and you may salvage the non-book balancing side of things. More to the point, go in with eyes wide open, and with someone who has experience and knowledge.</li><li><strong>Did this fail because of intractable leadership style: </strong>whether it was your own, or someone elseÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s, sometimes the leopard cannot change its spots when it comes to leadership. Be prepared to accept this. There is a famous example of John Chambers, CEO of Cisco, who admitted he used to be a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœcommand and controlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ leader, but has managed to change his style and has fostered such a successful atmosphere of collaboration within the company that there are now over 500 managers working in collaborative groups. ButÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ for every John Chambers and Cisco, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a SONY. If you are within an non-collaborative environment, sometimes you simply need to move on.</li><li><strong>Some partnerships arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t meant to be. </strong>ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that simple. People are people; and some people are like oil and water. They are never going to mix. And thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s OK Ã¢â‚¬â€œ this may be the case between two individuals, or two companies. If this happens, look for an alternative viable solution. If you try to force collaboration, it wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work.</li></ul><br>Which is probably my biggest point. The whole thing about commercial collaboration is that you are dealing with people, rather than abstract concepts. So that comes back to you as a person. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t force a relationship Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and above all else, trust your gut. Your instincts are there for a reason.

But life is better when you have sales. Here is why I encourage people to spend a ratio of 50:1 on sales versus capital.<br/> The goal is to build a business, not start a startup. Good business is the creation of value and the realisation of that is profit, which is when your revenues are more than your costs. You want to keep your costs down but none of that matters without revenue.<br/> <strong>Sales shows value</strong> <br/> Product market fit is the goal of all startups and nothing says that those two things fit together in a real, business like way than sales. A customer saw so much value in the product that they gave you hard earned money for it.<br/> <strong>Sales pays for things</strong> <br/> Cash in the bank lets you pay for servers, 2 minute noodles, bandwidth. For team members, it&rsquo;s a great day when your equity is worth more than cash, so you would rather pay for things than give away equity.<br/> <strong>Sales pays for growth</strong> <br/> Having a scalable growth model means when you spend a dollar on sales and marketing, more than a dollar comes back. Without revenue, the only way to keep growing is diluting through capital raising or crossing your fingers for &lsquo;going viral&rsquo;.<br/> <strong>Sales attracts investors</strong> <br/> Of all the numbers we think about sales is the hardest for someone to reject. Visits, users, engagement and retention are all nice but nothing says &lsquo;there is something here&rsquo; to an investor like sales.<br/> <strong>Sales avoids investors</strong> <br/> On the flip side, having enough sales can mean that you don&rsquo;t need an investor. Who wants to raise money if they can fund costs and growth with sales?<br>So stop going to capital raising events and start going to sales events. Read sales books. Hire sales people.

You need to pick those that really matter. <br>The other reason why 3 is good, is it makes you find a simple way to communicate progress which is important for team, investors, spouses and yourself. <br><strong>Which 3?</strong> <br>The rule should be that if this number improves, your business is substantially working. It should be an indicator of real value. Something substantial that canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be faked, crammed for or easily replicable. <br>Here are some of the things I look for in a good metric.<br><strong>Value To Your Customer</strong> <br>One of the best metrics to track is the actual value you create for your customer. I often say that you need to create 10x value for new customers of a new product which means if the total cost of the product (including price, risk, time, etc) is $100 then you need to add $1,000 of value to get them to use it. So understanding the value your customers get and measuring it is obviously a great metric to track. <br><strong>Actioned confirmation of value</strong> <br>I like numbers which mean that there has been clear acknowledgement by a real customer that they got value out of the product. Unfortunately this doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just mean a sale. A sale may mean that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re good at sales. It doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mean that you created value that the customer appreciated. The second sale does. Or a renewal does.<br>For a free product, it needs to be serious usage to show that people are really using your product. Typically this means usage multiple times over a sustained period. <br><strong>Externally Valued</strong> <br>Another test is would that number be meaningful to someone outside the organisation. i.e. an investor. This can also be looked at as sellable value Ã¢â‚¬â€œ if you had a bunch of that metric would someone buy this. People buy contracts with customers or seriously engaged users that are in some way locked in.<br><br><strong>Examples of Good Ã¢â‚¬Å“3 MetricsÃ¢â‚¬Â?</strong><ul type="disc"><li>Renewed paying customers.</li><li>People used the product three days in a row.</li><li>Gross profit from renewed customers.</li><li>Conversion of trial to paid Ã¢â‚¬â€œ means they saw the value and want to commit to it.</li><li>Money saved for your customers.</li><li>Time saved for your customers.</li><li>Money made for your customers.</li></ul>', 'The things you need to look for in a good metric', 'Value To Your Customer.

Your circumstances may change, the customers may change, the market may change.

You might need distribution, IP, or other things that are impossible or just too high risk to pursue on your own. Lots of buy outs donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work out well, but some are just what is needed.

This gives gut reactions the credit they deserve. Rebranding the expression is only the first step, though. We need to develop mechanisms to make this faster intelligence louder, more lucid, and more pronounced. Below are four examples of how to liberate your faster intelligence. <br><br/><strong>1. Flip a coin.</strong><br/>Need to make an extremely important decision that could change the course of your life for the months or years to come? An easy way to help make that decision is to simply flip a coin. If you are torn between a binary decision, flip a coin and assign tails to Ã¢â‚¬Å“yesÃ¢â‚¬Â? and heads to Ã¢â‚¬Å“no.Ã¢â‚¬Â? Then, when the coin lands on either side, listen to the immediate gut reaction you feel to the results of the coin toss. If you feel a sense of sadness or disappointment, then you know that you need to do the opposite of what the coin told you.<br><br/><strong>2. Drink beer.</strong> <br/><a href="http://www.foundrygroup.com/" target="_blank">The Foundry Group</a> in Boulder has a simple value that I love. Before they will invest into a prospective startup, they ask themselves if the team they are going to invest in passes the Ã¢â‚¬Å“beer test.Ã¢â‚¬Â? In short, is it a team of individuals who they would enjoy having a beer with. If the answer is yes, then they move forward with looking at the deal; if the answer is no, they wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t place the investment and they discontinue exploring the opportunity.<br><br/><strong>3. Eat dinner.</strong><br/>An incredible team leader, <a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/caroline-whaley/47/3b/524" target="_blank">Caroline Whaley</a>, once told me a simple framework for knowing if you are working with the right team or not. She asked me to consider that if I went to dinner with my team, are there people IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d rather sit next to and others who IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d hope I didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t get sat next to? If the answer here is yes, that likely means you need to have a serious heart to heart conversation with the people you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to sit next to as something is clearly off.<br><br/><strong>4. Surround yourself.<br/></strong> ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a saying that you are the amalgamation of the five people who you spend the majority of your time with. If this is true, then I highly recommend ensuring that you spend a great deal of time with the type of people who will help give you permission to follow your intuition and listen to your faster intelligence. If none of the people you spend the majority of your time with encourage you along this trajectory, then I suggest seeking out a new friend or two, or immersing yourself into a new community, in addition to your current friends.', 'Four examples of how to liberate your faster intelligence.', 'Flip a coin.

Part way through our conversation we started to share some of the more significant entrepreneurial mistakes weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve made over the past year, these regrets were correlated directly to a time that we Ã¢â‚¬Å“out-smartedÃ¢â‚¬Â? our initial gut reaction. <br/>I am now convinced we need to rebrand the expression, Ã¢â‚¬Å“listen to your gut.Ã¢â‚¬Â? I think rebranding is the first step to preventing our rational minds from Ã¢â‚¬Å“out-thinkingÃ¢â‚¬Â? our raw intuition. <br><br/><strong>A Re-branding is Needed</strong><br/>I think that the reason we often ignore our gut is because it has been improperly branded. When we think of it as a gut reaction, it feels like our decision making process is nothing more than a fleeting feeling in our abdomen. In reality, as a good friend <a href="http://unreasonable.is/video/sometimes-life-throws-you-a-curveball/" target="_blank">Eduardo Garcia</a> recently told me, listening to your gut is your bodyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s millisecond reaction to a situation that is the result of all the decisions, experiences, and lessons youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve had throughout your entire life. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s your body making an intuitive response at the apex of all your life experiences. When you think about it in this light, you can start to see why listening to oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gut is actually a reputable source for making tough decisions. If I were to re-brand the word IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d change it from Ã¢â‚¬Å“listen to your gutÃ¢â‚¬Â? to Ã¢â‚¬Å“listen to your faster intelligence.Ã¢â‚¬Â? <br><br/><strong>A Prediction</strong><br/>Just a few weeks ago I was sharing with George Kembel. George told me that he believes in the years to come we are going to see a massive shift in how leaders, teachers, parents, designers, and entrepreneurs make their decisions. George believes (and I agree) that soon, listening to your gut is going to become a compelling reference for making hard decisions and for making strategic decisions. <br/>So, I say letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all get ahead of this trend and together, letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s re-brand the expression so that we give our gut-reaction the credit it deserves. If you call it your faster-intelligence youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll give yourself that important permission, and the confidence needed to follow it. The second step to making this as mainstream as George suggests, I believe, is to start building simple frameworks around how we can more easily hear and listen to this faster intelligence.', 'How and why listen to our gut', 'As individuals and as a society we need to start listening to our gut intuition and giving it the decision making credit it deserves.

Of course, there are good ways and there are bad ways of going about working with friends: Below IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve included what IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve learned from trial and error about diving into working relationships and partnerships with those I consider to be my closest friends. <br/>How to do business with friends:<ul><li><strong>Communicate. Communicate. Communicate.</strong> The importance of sincere, authentic, and frequent communication cannot be understated. I do weekly 1-on-1 calls with all my partners and teammates, weekly meetings, daily quick standup meetings, once a month 48 hour work-sessions and once a quarter for a longer retreat. We talk about points of tension, points of gratitude, concerns, Ã¢â‚¬Å“yellow flags,Ã¢â‚¬Â? life beyond work, personal goals and aspirationsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦etc. This level of communication pay dividends and ensure that tensions never build up and that our team culture values authentic, frequent, and honest communication.</li><li><strong>Vest your ownership.</strong> Most co-founders start their companies by evenly splitting their ownership in the business between the friends they start the company with. But often times, this will end up in a disaster. For example, if you start a business with your best friend and split the equity 50/50, what if one year into the business your friend decides to take a full time job on Wallstreet? They will still own 50% of the company and now that they arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t actively working on the business, this will likely ruin your friendship. Instead, I recommend that you vest equity over a 4 year period and that you install what is called a one year Ã¢â‚¬Å“cliff.Ã¢â‚¬Â? This means that if any of the partners left the company within 12 months of starting the business, they will not get any equity (i.e. this is the Ã¢â‚¬Å“cliffÃ¢â‚¬Â?). By planning not just for the best but also for the potential of plans changing, you will save both your friendship and, likely, your company in the process. </li><li><strong>Make damn certain your motivations are inline.</strong> A good friend of mine had a brilliant team behind a new startup and everyone was motivated to make it happen. But when she sat down with her co-founders, she realized that their motivations were unsynchronized. Immediately, she listened to her intuition and decided not to continue with the startup. Typically with friends, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy to dive into a startup opportunity or a working relationship that is exciting, fun, and could be lucrative. But if your motivations arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t aligned, whether itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in a few months or a few years, your partnership will undoubtedly fall apart. </li><li><strong>DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t live together for too long.</strong> Although itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a fun way to start a new business and it ensures that you are all fully immersed, my feelings are that if you want to live with your friends + co-founders, do so with an exit strategy in mind (i.e. give it a set time commitment and after 6 months or 12 months, plan on living elsewhere).

I saw productivity and my ability to grind through work as my edge. Today, I can say confidently that my focus point then, although important, was misguided. Nearly a decade later, and after having found or co-found 9 companies since, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve come to believe something different. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s best explained by this equation: effectiveness > efficiency.<br/>I used to scoff at the belief that working smart trumped working hard. From observation alone, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never met an entrepreneur who has done something historically significant without pulling routine all-nighters. A big part of me has always agreed with Thomas Edison who said: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Genius is one percent inspiration, ninety-nine percent perspiration.Ã¢â‚¬Â? However, today, I now believe itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not that working hard trumps working smart. Instead, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that as a team and as an individual, you must first work smart, then hard. Working hard first is an empty sense of productivity to an end not worth caring about. <br/>The most important question, far more important than the pace at which you reached the summit, is whether or not you climbed the right mountain. Today, I believe one of the most common causes of failure in the startup world is simple: you climbed the wrong mountain and you felt great the entire way up because you were moving at an incredibly fast pace. I am the first to attest, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve done this time and time again. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve raced for the summit before I considered fully the context, our resources, the competition, or market timing. Today, at <a href="http://unreasonablegroup.com" target="_blank">Unreasonable Group</a>, we now ask ourselves once a week, Ã¢â‚¬Å“are we climbing the right mountain?Ã¢â‚¬Â? Climbing the right mountain is a new core value of our team. We live by it.

This is just one guyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s opinion on what not to do when creating a brand.<br/>Disclaimers aside, I think, for entrepreneurs, brand consulting firms and PR firms are the last outlet you want to explore when establishing your brand and getting your word out there. <br><br/><strong>Brands must resonate</strong><br/>A good brand resonates with the people you are trying to affect. And we resonate and feel most connected with authenticity, audacity, boldness, vulnerability, and the imperfections that come along with being human. Your brandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s genesis must originate from your core and from the emotive reasons you are creating it. If you are an entrepreneur, you are about to dedicate the next 5 to 50 years towards solving a problem you desperately care about with an idea you obsessively believe in. Let that obsession and the vulnerability that comes along with trying to do something far larger than yourself, shine through your brand. Take the time to work with your team and build a brand that comes from you. Find the essence of why you do what you do and it is that essence that will pull on the heart strings and capture the intrigue of your customers and followers.<br><br/><strong>Great Brands donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t come from consensus Ã¢â‚¬â€œ They come from your gut</strong><br/>Bill Cosby when asked what the key to success was he responded by saying:<br/>I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know the key to success, but the key to failure is trying to please everyone. <br/>If you are going to make a truly authentic and edgy brand, one that really resonates, I do not believe you can build this through consensus. Most consultancies and PR firms use a consensus based decision-making framework and although sometimes that is critical, when building a brand, this will ensure yours is average. A good example is how we even chose the name for the Unreasonable Institute. <br/>The first person I asked, naturally, was my mother (<em>as she is right about everything 99.99% of the time</em>). We then did a survey of 6 different names (<em>Unreasonable Institute one of them</em>) and sent it out to a friend base of a few hundred individuals. I then asked a few Ã¢â‚¬Å“expertsÃ¢â‚¬Â? in branding for their opinions on the Ã¢â‚¬Å“UnreasonableÃ¢â‚¬Â? name and they all agreed it was just too bold and one even said, too Ã¢â‚¬Å“irrationalÃ¢â‚¬Â?. They thought it might upset some people and that many others wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t understand it. HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the truth, they were probably right. But what IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve learned over the years is that you need to have Ã¢â‚¬Å“outsidersÃ¢â‚¬Â? to have Ã¢â‚¬Å“insidersÃ¢â‚¬Â? when it comes to a brand. You want to have a niche, an exclusive group who can say, proudly and unequivocally that they are Ã¢â‚¬Å“x.Ã¢â‚¬Â?

Really, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about how you treat the people you know and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about being excited and confident about what you do know and honest about what you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know. And if you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know someone, ideally this blog post will allow you to approach and get to know anyone.<br/>The 7 To Dos<br/><br/><strong>1) The Person You Are Talking To Is The Messiah In The Room.</strong><br/>One of the most important keys to building powerful relationships is never to avert your eyes when you are talking with someone else. Holding eye contact, even amidst a bustling room or people chatting nearby enables you to be fully present in your conversations and shows the other person how important they are to you. Assume, therefore, that the person you are conversing with is the momentary messiah.<br><br/><strong>2) Listen & Learn. Then Speak.</strong> <br/>When you meet someone, never start by talking about yourself. Ask them not just what they do, ask them why they do what they do and how they got to be doing what they do (i.e. their story). This will allow you to listen and to identify their interests, passions, and what excites them. You always want to connect on a human level (not just a professional level) and the key is to understand stories and interests. Learn what gets them excited and then get them excited. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just that simple. <br><br/><strong>3) Be Vulnerable</strong> <br/>Your greatest strength in establishing powerful relationships is to be honest about your greatest weaknesses. The truth is that moments of vulnerability are the very moments when we connect most with other people. People are also much more likely to find you credible when youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re honest up-front about the risks of your venture or when you answer Ã¢â‚¬Å“I honestly donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know the answerÃ¢â‚¬Â? instead of trying to come up with a clever defense on the spot. <strong><br><br/>4) IsnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Networking Slimy?</strong><br/>When we think about networking, we think of people who cleverly manipulate others to get what they want. Instead, Keith Ferrazzi, the greatest networker in the world, defines networking as Ã¢â‚¬Å“sharing my knowledge and resources, time and energy, friends and associates, and empathy and compassion in a continual effort to provide value to others, while coincidentally increasing my own.Ã¢â‚¬Â? In other words, you should be seeing how you can help other people achieve their full potential. Relationships are built on trust. You gain trust by helping others, not by asking what they can do for you.<br><br/><strong>5) You Have to Make the Ask (no excuses):</strong> <br/>One of the most important rules of building relationships and networking is simply to ask. It all boils down to being truthful. If someone can really help you with something, do not be hesitant to ask. Indeed, most people are reluctant to ask for money, for advice, or for anything that could help them to a realized dream. When you ask for help, and if you do so genuinely, the worst anyone will say is Ã¢â‚¬Å“no.Ã¢â‚¬Â? Then you are no worse off than if you hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t asked for help at all! <strong><br><br/>6) Follow Up and Follow Through:</strong><br/>After any great conversation, follow-up by simply letting the person know how much you appreciate their time and thoughts. And if you want to distinguish yourself from nearly 99% of everyone out there, follow-through on the promises you make. The key to this statement is to make certain that when you tell someone you are going to do something, you will have the time to do it well.<br><br/><strong>7) Conviction is Paramount</strong> <br/>If you are going to get others excited about what you are doing you have to believe in what you are doing more than anyone else in the world. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be afraid to express your excitement and your unreasonable ambition. Remember though, you must be confident about what you do know, but equally important about what you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know. This level of transparency is key to building quality relationships and to networking. People are perceptive. If you arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t genuine, they will know it.', '7 To do''s when networking.', 'The Person You Are Talking To Is The Messiah In The Room. Listen & Learn. Then Speak. Be Vulnerable.

Instead, you can build upon many of the resources and ideas that already exist in the world. And, when you combine them in new waysÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ you are able to do great things quickly. This post exists to give you resources that have already done that for you. If you leverage the resources below, you will be shocked at how quickly you can come up with beautiful designs for your startup, company, campaign, or event. <br><br/><strong>1. Choosing the right font.</strong><br/><a href="http://dafont.com" target="_blank">dafont.com</a>. They have over 17,000 fonts, many of which will blow your mind, and they are all free and easy to install. <br><br/><strong>2.

Our focus will be on the innovation cultures, startup communities, and creative ecosystems of the places we visit and the people we meet. This first post is a reflection on time spent in Japan. <br><br/><strong>Seven Takeaways From Japan</strong> <br><br/><strong>1. Etiquette is Paramount:</strong> Whether this is in regards to how your greet people or how important it is to delicately exchange business cards with both hands, or even how you should never pour your own sake, Japanese culture seemed to be centered around tradition, piety, and overt politeness.<br><br/><strong>2. Business Cards=SomeoneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Face:</strong> In Japan, a business card is seen as a representation of a personÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s identityÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ Specifically, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seen as analogous to oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s face. So when someone hands you a card, you must accept it with a bow and with two outstretched arms, you must admire it for an extended period of time, and you need to be careful to not fold it and to never let them see you put their card in your pocket. <br><br/><strong>3. Looks can be deceiving: </strong>I heard again and again that the greatest hindrance to having a vibrant entrepreneurial eco-system in Japan is rooted in people being too polite. Often times, someone will tell you that they love your idea or that they would like to work with you in one way or another. They will then go home and the truth will come out <em>(i.e. they think your idea is awful and they would never work with you)</em>. Without having a culture of constructive criticism and honest dialogue, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s difficult for entrepreneurs to be challenged and to quickly get market feedback and advice from investors and mentors that they need to hear.<br><br/><strong>4. No dinner parties:</strong> It is very uncommon to go over to a friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s or a colleagueÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s house for dinner. In fact, it is so uncommon that I met two individuals who told me that in the past 5 years, both of them had only eaten 3 times in another friends or co-workerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s house. Real networking happens over meals at restaurants and in the Karaoke bars.<br><br/><strong>5. Karaoke is no Joke:</strong> What I quickly learned is that in Japan, deals happen while you are making a fool of yourself and singing at the top of your lungs. Karaoke, although it may seem silly, is dead serious when it comes to business.<br><br/><strong>6. Design is Everywhere:</strong> While walking throughout the streets of Japan, there is an incredible amount of intention, design, and thought that seems to go into nearly every building, piece of art, garden, meal, greeting, and walkway. In todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world, where design is now obligatory, I feel that this attention to detail will give Japan a real leg up on other creative communities and startup ecosystems.<br><br/><strong>7. Incremental vs. Exponential:</strong> I heard again and again from entrepreneurs, politicians, and investors that what is holding Japan back most from having an explosive startup scene is that the Japanese are by-and-large risk adverse. The focus of most startups is on the 10% increase in efficiency or profit instead of on the 10x Ã¢â‚¬Å“moonshotÃ¢â‚¬Â? idea.', 'Seven business practices from Japan.', 'Etiquette is Paramount.

But for those that do, they raise on incredibly friendly valuation terms relative to other areas of the business world. The reason is growth and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s useful to apply the metaphors of physics to understand why. <br/> One of the most unanswerable questions I get as investor is Ã¢â‚¬Å“what do my metrics need to be to raise a series AÃ¢â‚¬Â?. I can give a guide on numbers but the reality is that the static one dimensional numbers ($100k MRR, 1m MAU or whatever the most important metric for the business is) are only half the story. <br/> IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll use the three simple concepts of physics Ã¢â‚¬â€œ distance, velocity and acceleration Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and use a SaaS business and monthly recurring revenue (MRR) to explain why. <br/> A common piece of advice, is that you need $100k MRR to raise a Series A ($5-10m) in todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s market. But the problem with that simple answer is that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not about the $100k figure (the distance in this analogy) nor even about how quickly MRR is growing (velocity), itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about how quickly the change in MRR is growing (acceleration). <br/> If you have a startup who grows to $100k MRR by adding $2k MRR each month for 50 months (4+ years), you are unlikely to be able to raise a Series A. If the $2k MRR you are adding doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t itself growing ever bigger (acceleration), the business is not a great candidate for venture financing. <br/> So the first step investors tackle is evaluating the foundation of the building (how engaged and happy are the customers, how often do they use the product, how rarely do they unsubscribe from it etc.) and then they bet on the law of compounding growth and hang on for a long period of time. <br/> The rate of growth really matters alot. Acceleration letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s you keep that rate of growth. And itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all about the acceleration not the distance.', 'Why You CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Raise a Series A', 'If you have a startup who grows to $100k MRR by adding $2k MRR each month for 50 months, you are unlikely to be able to raise a Series A.

Like urging a developer to talk to customers, the most common theme of advice I give to Australian entrepreneurs is to dial up their ambition. But those words are superficial and the truth is more subtle.<br/> Ambition is the process of turning over a series of rocks and discovering what works and what doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t. Ambition is the reaction to positive information: do you grow thirsty and change your behaviour to be more aggressive or do you continue along your merry way?<br/> Facebook was originally started as a way for a few college kids to meet girls and not even to be a company.

While some smart restaurants do feature a few specials (some even with pictures), most places fail at this very simple (largely offline!) innovation. Fewer items with pictures &amp; more obvious recommendations would streamline production, reduce cost, reduce time for customers to order, for kitchens to prepare, and increase customer satisfaction.<br><strong>Problem #2: Not Online, No Order History, No Reviews, No Friends, No Loyalty Program. Also, No A/B Testing.</strong><br><strong>First</strong>, it would be great if the restaurant knew something about my order history and user profile data, and customized the menu selection to my favorite tastes and interests. This would again streamline choice, reduce time &amp; confusion, and increase customer satisfaction. <br><strong>Second</strong>, if there were any kind of online reviews, it would be great to combine this with the actual menu so i can see whether other people loved or hated specific dishes. <br><strong>Third</strong>, it would be even <em>better</em> if i could see if any of my friends had eaten at the restaurant before, and whether <em>they</em> liked or hated anything in particular. My level of trust would go up even more.<br><strong>Fourth</strong>, by managing customer order history, favorites &amp; specials, and social connectivity, it should be easy to implement a loyalty program and retention marketing program that could increase purchase behavior, customer satisfaction, and frequency. And, by aggregating data across the entire customer base, restaurants should be able to learn how to optimize their inventory, pricing, and marketing campaigns dramatically better than ever before.<br><strong>Problem #3: Have to Wait FOREVER for Waiter to Order, Re-Order, &amp; Pay. Also, Nothing To Do While I&rsquo;m Waiting.</strong><br>Obviously, one of the biggest pains in the ass when you&rsquo;re at a restaurant is trying to get the waiter&rsquo;s attention that you need something, and/or waiting around for them to notice that you 1) need a menu / are ready to order, or 2) have a question about something on the menu, or 3) need some water or another drink, or 4) want to order dessert, or 5) are ready to pay can we get the check? or 6) hey i&rsquo;ve got a question about my bill, or 7) hey i&rsquo;d really like that check now please? <br>In any case, being able to message and connect with the wait staff / kitchen staff, and being able to pay online and whenever you want is likely to improve customer satisfaction (and worker satisfaction!) dramatically, as well likely to reduce turnover time and streamline overall operations. Not to mention, having the ability to check and confirm your order online, as you eat it, and the ability to modify and add/upsell as you go would be absolutely awesome. Again, being able to combine payment with purchase history, social referrals, and customized specials and time-sensitive offers (price optimization for inventory, etc) could be absolutely huge.<br>Furthermore, once you have connectivity / tabletop devices, the opportunity to do other things while you&rsquo;re waiting can be a great benefit.', 'The problem with menus', 'Too Many Items, Not Enough Pictures, Simpler & More Obvious Recommendations.

We got onto the topic of audience segmentation and were brands really at the point where they had the data and the means to segment their audience. When I asked the audience if they thought they were advanced enough in their social program to really segment their audience, the response was overwhelmingly NO! When asked if they thought they should be, the answer was overwhelmingly YES!<br>Many brands have spent considerable effort and money trying to build social audiences of scale. So why do they&nbsp;not know more about the makeup of that audience? <br>It seems obviously compelling that as a brand interacts with consumers on a social channel, where that individual often provides a considerable amount of information about themselves (of their own free will), why would the brand not try to gather that information and use it to better understand the consumer. Yet many marketers are still fixated on building&nbsp;scale, and not on building depth of understanding.<br>Does size of our audience help us to sell more product or drive revenue? No, not in and of itself. Only by connecting with customers more deeply and building that relationship, or by converting more prospects to customers, do we grow sales. <br>As we build the depth of understanding, it opens a world of possibilities for driving our social marketing investment&nbsp;harder. We can obviously do some of the following:<br><br><ul type="disc"> <li>You can start by transitioning from &ldquo;en-masse&rdquo; to segmented marketing based on known and desired customer behaviour.</li><li>We can obviously measure&nbsp;which&nbsp;segment of your audience is the most viable to target, so you&nbsp;can start avoiding the scatter gun approach many brands currently employ. Just the simple exercise of using Facebook Custom Audiences is more effective, if you know which audience is the most likely to convert from prospect to customer.</li><li>We can obviously start A/B testing our audience against offers, and track conversion.</li><li>And when we have really started to gain insights, we can start getting quite personal with offers and focusing on re-engaging each member of our audience on a continuous cycle, designed to build brand loyalty and advocacy.</li></ul><br>Segmentation is a major transition point in social marketing, that all brands should be working on.

The biggest reason is that your customers treat you differently.<br><strong>Here&rsquo;s how a sale works offline and online</strong><br>Think about a typical customer buying from an offline store &ndash; for example, a tourist in a new city who wants to buy some sunglasses. Here are four things that happen in the buying process:<br><ul type="disc"> <li>First, they <strong>choose</strong> &ndash; for example, by walking through a shopping mall or seeing a retail store on the street. </li><li>Typically, there are only <strong>a few options</strong> to choose from, and they choose one of them. </li><li>Generally that store has a <strong>reputation</strong>, because of the brands they sell, because many other customers are also in the store, or because it just <em>looks</em> reputable. </li><li>When they walk into the store, the <strong>sale</strong> starts. Even if a sales assistant does not come up to them immediately, they eventually talk to a salesperson, who guides them through the sale. </li></ul><br>Now contrast that with your online store, which also sells sunglasses. Consider a customer who comes to your Web site for the first time:<br><ul type="disc"> <li>They might <strong>stumble on</strong> you &ndash; say, through a Google or a link on somebody else&rsquo;s Web site. </li><li>When they did a Google search, there were <strong>many options</strong> for them to choose from &ndash; sometimes thousands and even millions. </li><li>Unless you are a well-known brand, you are an <strong>unknown</strong>. They can&rsquo;t see other customers buying at the same time, they can&rsquo;t be sure you will still be there next week if there are any problems, and they know that even scammers can build nice Web sites. </li><li>They don&rsquo;t immediately start a sales process. There isn&rsquo;t a live person there to chat with them about what they want, and answer their objections. There is still a lot of <strong>marketing</strong>. </li></ul><br><strong>Here&rsquo;s the biggest difference between offline and online sales </strong><br><ul type="disc"> <li>Offline, your customers are fairly comfortable about you when they enter your store. </li><li>Online, they have a lot of doubts. </li></ul><br>This might sound simplistic, but it&rsquo;s an important point. <strong>Your customer&rsquo;s frame of mind is different</strong>.<br>If you&rsquo;re planning to sell anything online, you have to work very, very hard to get the customer in the right frame of mind before you even start showing them your product or service.<br>Start with the four factors I&rsquo;ve mentioned: they are stumbling on you, you&rsquo;re just one of many options, you&rsquo;re an unknown, and you have to do a lot of marketing.

But sometimes you contribute to your own inbox problem by the way you <em>send</em> e-mail to others. With a few simple techniques, you can improve the e-mail you send, which helps the person receiving it, but also reduces the need for replies and unnecessary discussion.<br>This is not just about being thoughtful and considerate of other people - It also helps your own productivity, because your e-mails will be clearer and easier to understand, so other people won&rsquo;t have to keep writing back asking for more information.</p><strong>Agree on the protocol</strong>If most of your e-mail is sent between a few people, agree how frequently you (and everybody else) will be checking e-mail, so you have the appropriate expectations and don&rsquo;t fall into the trap of checking e-mail too often &ldquo;just in case something urgent turns up&rdquo;.<br><strong>Put it in context</strong><br>When somebody receives your e-mail, you don&rsquo;t know where they are, when they are reading it and what else is happening in their day. So don&rsquo;t assume they will remember anything about any earlier discussion. Give them enough context to be able to understand this message fully. Include relevant text from any earlier messages, ensure the subject line is appropriate, and re-read it carefully before sending it.<br><strong>Ask for an action</strong><br>Don&rsquo;t make the other person guess what you want and when you want it; <em>ask for it</em>. This is especially important if you&rsquo;re a leader or manager, because team members might view all e-mails from &ldquo;the boss&rdquo; as very important and very urgent.<br><strong>Use different messages for different topics</strong><br>Don&rsquo;t combine multiple topics in the one message.

Learn how to focus and you&rsquo;ll get much more done.<br>People often complain about constant interruptions and constant distractions in our fast-moving world. And they are right. But these are two totally different things! Interruptions happen because of other people, but distractions happen because of ourself. You can certainly do things to minimise interruptions, but you have far more control over distractions &ndash; so tackle them first.<br><strong3>1. Know what matters</strong>It&rsquo;s easier to say No to distractions when you have a bigger Yes driving your decisions. Know what&rsquo;s really important to you, and make sure you focus on those things.<br>Don&rsquo;t just make goals once a year, and then forget about them for the rest of the year. Instead, spend 15 minutes at the start of every day to list three important things you want to do that day. Whenever you get distracted or tempted by something else, go back to your list and check whether you&rsquo;re still on track.<br><strong>2. Force focus</strong><br>When many of our distractions come from the screen in front of us, taping cardboard to our glasses won&rsquo;t help. But there are high-tech equivalents, such as <a href="http://anti-social.cc/" target="_blank">the app Anti-Social</a>, which blocks social media sites for a block of time. <a href="http://gottcode.org/focuswriter/" target="_blank">FocusWriter</a> help with specific tasks for giving you a distraction-free screen for writing.<br><strong>3. Work in sprints</strong><br>If you just can&rsquo;t imagine spending an hour or two on one task, don&rsquo;t! Split up your time into smaller segments, so you can work really hard in that short segment and then take a break.<br>This is the thinking behind <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/" target="_blank">The Pomodoro Technique</a>. You do a short &ldquo;sprint&rdquo; of work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break, then get back to work for 25 minutes, and so on. The idea is that 25 minutes is long enough to get into a task, but not too long that you&rsquo;ll get distracted.<br><strong>4. Start keeping track</strong><br>Finally, it might be enlightening to just keep track of your time every day. That way, you&rsquo;ll know where your time goes, and that might be enough to convince you to take better care of it.<br>You can do this the old-fashioned way with a grid marked in 15-minute segments, where you just record (honestly!) what you&rsquo;re doing during the day.

That&rsquo;s not the only cause of poor webinars, of course, but it&rsquo;s one of the biggest.<br>In a webinar, your slides are not visual aids; they <em>are</em> the visuals. So you need to do more with them to engage your audience.<br>Here are five ways to create stunning slides for your next webinar.<br><strong>1. More slides</strong><br>Use more slides than you would in an in-person presentation, so your audience sees the screen changing often. Otherwise it&rsquo;s just too easy for them to ignore the screen and start checking e-mail or doing other work while listening to your webinar in the background.<br><strong>2. Make your slides more visual</strong><br>No more boring bullet lists! Your slides should be visual, not just a bunch of words.<br>This applies to all presentations, but especially to webinars, where again you need to keep your audience&rsquo;s attention on the screen. <br><strong>3. &ldquo;Build&rdquo; complex slides</strong><br>If a slide contains a lot of information, build it up step by step, talking through each step as you do so.<br>Look at the information on your slide and decide whether you can build up the slide piece by piece. It&rsquo;s easier for your audience to follow, and keeps them engaged while you go through your explanation.<br><strong>4. Make them load faster</strong><br>Slides with large pictures take longer to transmit over the Internet, so some of your audience might see them loading in a slow, jerky way. So as much as you want to make your slides visual, you don&rsquo;t want to fill them with big photos either. For slides that need pictures, use smaller pictures.</br><strong>5. Design them faster</strong><br>Finally, you need a system to build your slide decks fast; otherwise it&rsquo;s just too tempting to just slap something together with a bunch of bullet lists.<br>Subscribe to a stock photo library service like <a href="http://istock.com" target="_blank">istock.com</a> so you can find good pictures quickly. Also learn how to use PowerPoint&rsquo;s &ldquo;Smart Art&rdquo; feature, which turns bullet lists into visually appealing diagrams.', '5 Ways to create stunning visuals', 'More slides.

Don&rsquo;t fall into the trap of trying to prevent problems by adding extra layers of bureaucracy, control, hierarchy, documentation, systems, or processes. <em>Sometimes</em> this can be useful, but it can also create extra friction for everybody.<br>If you&rsquo;re going to add extra protection, make it simple, low-cost protection (like a bicycle helmet).

Her situation is that she already offers this as a public webinar series, and now wants to offer it to her corporate clients. Of course, they could just pay the same price as the public attendees, but she wants to offer them some other options as well.<br><strong>What&rsquo;s the best pricing model?</strong><br>First, of course, it&rsquo;s difficult to provide any specific advice that applies to all situations. So if you&rsquo;re in a similar situation, please consider these as general guidelines, and use them as a starting point for determing your own prices.<br>Here are some of the factors to consider:<br><ul type="disc"> <li><strong>Public program:</strong> Because you are already offering this program, that pricing gives you a starting point. You either offer a discount if they buy in bulk, or charge more if they are getting a customised / tailored / enhanced private version. </li><li><strong>Tiers:</strong> Yes, this is typically the way this works, with bigger discounts at the higher tiers. Make the upper tiers very attractive (i.e. big discount), because they will see high perceived value, whereas it costs you very little. </li><li><strong>Access to you:</strong> If they are getting a pre-recorded version of the program, without any access to you, they will value it less. If the webinars are live, of course they get access to you during the webinars. But you can also offer more access &ndash; e.g. e-mail/Skype support, bonus live sessions, bonus Q&amp;A sessions. </li><li><strong>Renewal:</strong> Do they buy it for a one-off fee, or do they need to renew their licence each year? If they do have to renew, make sure you can justify <em>why</em> they need to renew &ndash; e.g. because they get updated material, or additional training, or additional resources.</li> <li><strong>Additional resources:</strong> Do they get additional resources that the general public don&rsquo;t get? If so, you can charge a higher fee for these resources &ndash; e.g. private coaching, private follow-up sessions, the organisation&rsquo;s branding throughout. </li></ul><br>Finally, if this is the first time you&rsquo;re doing this, try to arrange this so that you don&rsquo;t lock yourself into the pricing forever. The more you can position this as a one-off deal for one particular client, the better. That gives you the flexibility to experiment, and then refine it next time.', 'Factors to consider when choosing a pricing model for your webinar', 'Public program. Tiers. Access to you. Renewal.

In other words, you&rsquo;re putting the context around it so they know it&rsquo;s right for them. </li><li><strong>Collate with perspective</strong>: Look for patterns in the world and bring them together in a relevant and meaningful way for your network. It&rsquo;s your job as an expert to take a &ldquo;big picture&rdquo; view of specific things and point out patterns that others don&rsquo;t see. </li><li><strong>Create unique material</strong>: Finally, of course, you do need to generate and share your own ideas.

Of course, you could just do teleconferencing (audio but no video), but allowing participants to see each other makes a stronger connection. </li><li>Use <strong>collaborative mind mapping tools</strong> for exploring ideas within the team. </li><li>Use a <strong>virtual whiteboard</strong> for facilitating discussion, capturing ideas, and brainstorming. </li></ul><br>There is one other point worth noting about teamwork: Virtual teams don&rsquo;t suffer as much from the negative personality issues within in-person teams &ndash; for example, stereotyping, power battles, petty quarrels, and personality conflicts.

For example, one of my clients licences his online courses to clients, and they send him the list of names to enrol in the course. This is a bit of extra work on his part, but enables him to easily keep track of the number of users &ndash; and bill the client accordingly. </li><li>Don&rsquo;t worry about the really determined IP thief. It creates too much of a burden for you and your legitimate clients. For example, in that previous example of the client with online courses, there&rsquo;s nothing to stop a client from enrolling one person and then sharing the material with everybody else. But it&rsquo;s too much effort to prevent that sort of abuse. </li><li>That said, if you do find somebody using your materials illegally, raise the issue with them.

However, you might consider this as one factor in setting the price &ndash; such as advertising, paying guest presenters, or paying somebody to be the host while you&rsquo;re the presenter. You should also factor in the cost of your own time.<br><strong>Bad Idea #2: Competitor pricing</strong><br>This works well for well-understood products and services, where customers typically make decisions by comparing prices. Unfortunately, this usually isn&rsquo;t the case for webinars, because they are still novel. Your customers probably can&rsquo;t find another competing webinar to compare with; and even if they did, it&rsquo;s not like comparing breakfast cereals, cars or mobile phone plans.<br><strong>Good Idea #1: Equivalent product</strong><br>Start by considering the price of an equivalent in-person presentation, and set your price accordingly. If you deliver the same value to your participants, there&rsquo;s no reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t charge a similar price. <br>However, when setting your price this way, you do have to be careful of two things:<br><ul type="disc"> <li>Value, like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. For instance, some people like the opportunity to get out of the office, enjoy interacting with others at a workshop.</li><li>You have to work hard to convince attendees your webinar does in fact offer the same, or comparable, value to an in-person presentation. <strong></strong></li></ul><br><strong>Good Idea #2: High demand</strong><br>If there is a high demand for your topic area, obviously you can charge a higher price. However, in my experience, business owners often over-estimate their value, and are disappointed when their market doesn&rsquo;t share their belief! It&rsquo;s easy to fool yourself into thinking your topic really is in high demand. So when assessing demand, be sure you&rsquo;re doing this from your market&rsquo;s viewpoint.<br><strong>Good Idea #3: Urgent need</strong><br>Topics that address current needs are in high demand, and usually command a higher price. We&rsquo;ve talked about high demand already, but I want to address urgency separately because this is one area where you can actively demonstrate urgency in your client&rsquo;s mind.<br>A more respectful approach is to explain why now, more than ever, your topic is important and relevant.

But if you use it for referrals, renewals, and repeat business, it can be much easier, more cost-effective and more profitable.<br>So here are five simple ways to get more repeat, referral and renewal business through your Web site and other online marketing tools <br><strong>1. Publish a regular client newsletter.</strong><br>Do your clients only hear from you when you send them a bill? Publish a monthly (at least) e-mail newsletter just for clients, with high-value material that your general subscribers don&rsquo;t get.<br>That material doesn&rsquo;t even have to be your own. You can &ldquo;curate&rdquo; and share other people&rsquo;s material, as long as you do it with permission (or just link to it).<br><strong>2. Make them special offers.</strong><br>Give clients access to products and services that others don&rsquo;t get. Or give them <em>special</em> access &ndash; such as bundling in other products and services at the same time.<br><strong>3. Encourage them to invite a friend.</strong><br>If you run special events for clients, allow them to invite a friend or two. This is better than just asking for a referral, because the client is doing a favour to their friend, not to you.<br><strong>4. Recommend other people in your network.</strong><br>Your clients have come to <em>you</em> to solve a problem, but in solving that problem you&rsquo;re likely to discover other problems as well. Even if you can&rsquo;t solve them yourself, refer them to others who can. Your client will appreciate you taking the time to think beyond your narrow scope of business.<br><strong>5. Be accessible and current.</strong><br>If clients do refer people to your Web site, is it easy for those people to contact you? They are more valuable than somebody who just stumbles over your site, so make sure you make their life easy. For example:<br><ul type="disc"> <li>List full contact information <em>(including a phone number!)</em> on every page. </li><li>Make it easy for <em>somebody who knows what they are looking for</em> to find it. </li><li>Don&rsquo;t force them to jump through hoops to get to the information they need. </li></ul>', 'Online marketing techniques to get more business', 'Publish a regular client newsletter.

But if you focus on the things it does best, you can get a lot of value from it.<br><strong>1. Profile</strong><br>Use LinkedIn to post your &ldquo;CV&rdquo; or &ldquo;resume&rdquo;, so people who do want to know more about you can find something. This is not a traditional CV you would write when seeking a job. Rather, it&rsquo;s a promotional profile piece that positions you as an expert and authority. <br><strong>2. Networking</strong><br>Think about going to a business networking function. The people you hate there are those that are too self-promoting while the people you love are those who take an interest in you and genuinely look for ways to help you.<br>LinkedIn is the same. Don&rsquo;t promote yourself too much. Position yourself as a trusted advisor, not a pushy salesperson.<br><strong>3. Testimonials</strong><br>In the physical world, you might write a testimonial, or bring it up in conversation with your friend. But what if you don&rsquo;t know your friend is looking for that service? And what if the supplier hasn&rsquo;t promoted your testimonial well?<br>LinkedIn solves both these problems by letting you put testimonials (LinkedIn calls them &ldquo;Recommendations&rdquo;) right there on the supplier&rsquo;s profile. It also encourages the supplier to reciprocate by writing a testimonial for you as well.<br><strong>4. Introductions</strong><br>The world works on recommendations, referrals and introductions. If I introduce you to somebody I know, that person already trusts you (to some extent). <br>LinkedIn works the same way in the online world. Use it to reach out to people you would like to reach, not just by contacting them out of the blue, but through somebody who knows you both. <br><strong>5. Peers and colleagues</strong><br>Finally, keep in mind that most of your LinkedIn connections are <em>not</em> your prospects. They are peers and colleagues who are connected to you for mutual gain. <br>On the contrary, LinkedIn can be one of your best sources of businesses. But think of it as getting business <em>through</em> your connections, not <em>from</em> them.

In this sort of community, you provide things training videos, webinars, e-books and special reports, audio downloads, online courses, an online support forum, and so on. </li><li><strong>Access:</strong> Special access to you.

So knowing the right mix of these services will guide you in choosing the correct platform.<br>For example, <strong>Ning</strong> is a great tool for creating a membership site that values community.

Let team members tell you the vision of the company in their words and see if it matches yours. <br>Treat team building as a more than an activity to diminish risk if founders leave. Having employees who understand and share your vision will make or break the business. <br>Bring on board people who understand and share your vision. Listen and give them a voice within the business and outside. <br><strong>Minimising quick-fix solutions</strong> <br>Key decisions need to be evaluated against the impact they have on realising the vision. Ignoring this will not only result in quick-fix solutions that don&rsquo;t deliver best results, but also increased costs and decreased efficiencies in the longer run.<br>Focus on the long term and you&rsquo;ll have better results.

I used social media to grow my networks by offering small social and ethical investment grants to other startups &ndash; focusing on issues such as literacy, women-led initiatives and youth empowerment activities.

Although financial returns might seem like the obvious answer, there are a growing number of people who do it for the lifestyle &ndash; to be part of the Silicon Valley buzz or receive awards for artistic projects. There are others who do it for positive <a href="http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/social-media-blogs/social-media-and-its-impact-on-the-sales-process-29062012.html" target="_blank">social impact</a> or to support a cause / passion.<br><strong>It is not like the stock market </strong> <br>Angel investment is different to trading in equities or investing in public markets. Investors are typically more hands on and involved in the company and its direction. There is no easy cash-in/ cash-out strategy and you can&rsquo;t predict risks as you would with stocks and mutual funds.<br>When you invest in a company, you usually buy into equity and not just a percentage of profits or revenue. The share of investment can&rsquo;t be easily divested, taken to the bank or cashed when you need money.<br><strong>Personal investment and history of entrepreneur</strong> <br>Know whether you want to invest in someone who has a history in managing startups or a young graduate with the next killer idea. Neither of these options are failsafe. You invest in ideas and people, so be sure you believe in the product and also look around at what is being said about the company and / or industry in social media and news.<br><strong>You don&rsquo;t have to do it alone</strong> <br>There are many active angel groups/ communities that you could join in Australia.

Exit planning should ideally start when your business does. <br>Thinking about exit from the business early on also gives you the acceptance and understanding of how much growth you can achieve within a given timeframe.<br><strong>Seek professional advice early</strong> <br>Start speaking to accountants, advisors and other planning experts prior to developing your exit strategy, so you know what factors to consider and are structuring it into feasible timeframes. Their help in building the valuation of your business is important to increasing the chances of selling at maximum price. Their due diligence and marketing advice will frame your strategies over the years leading up to the sale.<br><strong>Build your value </strong> <br>Managing price and valuation expectation at the start is essential to exit planning. As most small businesses often sell to people within their networks, it is also important to think about how they perceive the values of your company.<br><strong>Ensure the business can run without you</strong> <br>Owners/managers play a significant role in business &ndash; from product development, business generation to leadership and team management. However, buyers are interested in the business and not your job. <br>Investing in your employees and helping them grow is integral to building the value of the business and, getting the best price for it.<br><strong>Set a plan for yourself</strong> <br>Knowing what you want to do after you exit the business is as important as your exit strategy. <br>That&rsquo;s why, it is important to gradually make yourself redundant from the business by grooming your team, so you have time to cope with the change.

You will face challenges as an entrepreneur. But the good thing is that most challenges are the same that others in your situation have confronted before and overcome. As with leading a positive life, you learn from others and apply to your business.<br>Here are a few common challenges and easy suggestions to manage them:<br><strong>1. Pick the right idea: </strong>Talk to many, many people about your idea and research it fully. Belief in a product or service is great. But it&rsquo;ll only get you that far if people aren&rsquo;t willing to spend money. If you don&rsquo;t have an audience as yet, it is you and your vision that people are buying into &ndash; not just what you sell. Failure is often a result of lack of preparation and acceptance of what is achievable by you.<br><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Quality above all else:</strong> As an entrepreneur, you are constantly juggling payroll, bookkeeping, operational, manufacturing, customer service, issues management and many other tasks. More so when business is growing marginally but not enough to employ a support team. This is when most businesses drop their game. <br>Every customer is your indirect salesperson or brand advocate. Ensure their loyalty by giving them your best. If quality is being compromised, don&rsquo;t take on more customers.<br><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Finding the right customers: </strong>Understand who your customer is and build that community. Don&rsquo;t waste time on people who do not reciprocate interest in your product. Empower your customers to decide what they want by engaging with them. Pushiness often results in wasted effort and negative brand perception.<br><strong>4.</strong> <strong>Initial investment: </strong>If you don&rsquo;t have funding, start small and earn top dollar before you invest more. Make success your only option for more funding. Aim for higher profit margins than just increased revenue. Get a <a href="http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/featured/sustainable-cash-flow-strategies-for-service-businesses-28012014.html" target="_blank">sustainable cash flow</a> process going before investing more.<br><strong>5.</strong> <strong>Preparing for uncertainties: </strong>The only way you can put your fears to ease is by confronting them and having a plan to tackle uncertainty. Plan for the months when cash flow could be low and for a contingency if your product or service is replaced due to market innovation, or if you are hit with a recession. <br><strong>6.</strong> <strong>Finding the right employees: </strong>In your role as an employer, you are the mentor, leader and paycheck provider to the people you bring on board. Be prepared to do all three well. Beware of becoming a sounding board for someone else&rsquo;s issues and handholding them too much. Remember that leadership is defined by creating more leaders, not just by leading.

This is the first injection of capital into the idea or company. The most common funding at this stage comes from: personal savings, <a href="http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/finance-cash-flow/company-credit-cards-reap-rewards-06032014.html" target="_blank">credit cards</a>, family and friends, grants, bank borrowing and non-bank finance.<br>Most banks don&rsquo;t fund startups but lend against property.

Angels come in with money after you have started selling. They jump aboard because you now have tangible proof of concept.<br>Angel funding usually scales up to $2 million. Angel investors often play a big role in mentoring the business as well.

Given women angel investors and VC''s are a minority, there is no choice but to be brave and ask for more money. One of the best ways to break down gender stereotypes in the male dominated VC space will be to see more women entrepreneurs pitching confidently for funding.<br>The below pointers could help:<br><strong>Illustrate the opportunity and talk about the vision</strong>: It is important to pitch passionately and discuss current growth; but more so to illustrate future potential and the vision. Especially when women start a business that reflects their personal interests and have to pitch to men who lack those interests.<br><strong>Be confident</strong>: This goes beyond taking a few deep breaths and connecting with everyone in the room. Confidence in pitching for funding also stems from visualising why women entrepreneurs are successful. A <a href="http://www.dowjones.com/collateral/files/WomenPE_report_final.pdf" target="_blank">2012 study by Dow Jones</a> reported that 61% of start-ups with five or more females were successful and only 39% failed. Research success stories to take pointers and be inspired. <br><strong>Failure is good</strong>: Most women tend to take failure personally and get disheartened &ndash; which could affect their next pitch. Women should instead view failures as the opportunity to get feedback on their process and use it to nail their next pitch. Women are more risk averse then men and only when we cross this barrier and accept failure as part of constant growth will we succeed.<br><strong>Know your negotiation boundaries</strong>: Before you go into a pitch, know your negotiation baselines and don''t compromise beyond what you can''t or don''t want to. Investors will push to gauge commitment and determination and the pitch process is their first exposure to how you manage under that pressure. Don''t undersell the value of your business, its current success and the IP the team brings to the table.<br><strong>Use numbers wisely</strong>: I''ve seen women overuse statistics and metrics to support every point they make and from a belief that that''s the language male VC''s and investors understand. Numbers are only your proof point that supports the vision and not the pitch in itself. The pitch can be peppered with stats on customer in itself. The core story of how you generate more money can only evolve from selling acquisition, costs, unit economics, etc., but they need to flow into the strategy rather than becoming the strategy the vision.<br><strong>Showcase a clear ability to exit:</strong> Your exit strategy shows the strength of your financial plan and how soon investors can realise returns-on-investment (ROI). It''s fine to have the business as a hobby and something you will continue working on for a lifetime. If not, be sure to include your exit strategy highlighting how you''ll make $5 million in five years if that''s your vision. Investors will then be confident in your ability to deliver ROI as you are bound by a timeline.', 'Pointers for women entrepreneurs seeking for funding', 'Illustrate the opportunity and talk about the vision.

This is slowly changing. Women are capitalising on open markets, innovation and progress to investing their wealth and resources into other businesses. Women angel investors are the new breed mapping the entrepreneurial landscape.<br><strong>For women who are interested in investing in a business, here a few pointers to consider:</strong><br><ul type="disc"> <li><strong>Blend your passion with the business idea</strong>: When you start talking money, you will have people coming out of the woodworks trying to convince you to invest in their venture. While most ideas will be good, you will only be able to navigate the rush by identifying what you are passionate about at the outset. Match your passion to the business idea and not the other way around. </li><li><strong>Take risks and disrupt the landscape</strong>: The markets and industries are evolving at a phenomenal pace. To stay ahead of the game, businesses will have to adopt disruptive innovation methodologies. It is easy to trial a better concept of an existing product but nerve racking to do something that has no case study. Unfortunately, there is no magic formula to this approach &ndash; only trial and error. </li><li><strong>Crowdsourced funding</strong>: If you are donating only a portion of the funds to support the business, encourage the entrepreneur to consider crowdsourced funding opportunities. Websites such as Pozible and Kickstarter are great for this. </li></ul><br>The crowd-funding premise is based on the fact that people who fund the project connect with it more meaningfully and like something back in return. If it is a film then invite them to the opening or get them to contribute to the script, if products then give people free samples, if a service then discounts or acknowledgments on websites and social media &ndash; the opportunities are endless and not necessarily expensive.<br><ul type="disc"> <li><strong>Work the digital media</strong>: Social media is the new word-of-mouth and social footprint is the new brand equity. For start-ups that are cash tight, social media provides the best platform to communicate with stakeholders, communities and consumers with the most up-to-date information. Explore the possibilities and get the business to construct a cohesive social media strategy from start. </li></ul>', 'Points to consider when investing in a business', 'Blend your passion with the business idea.

Define your values</strong> <br>Early on, James Scollay, ran a session with me to define Posse&rsquo;s brand values. He suggested that I come up with up to five core values that, when combined, could govern the brand and company.&nbsp; My answers back then haven&rsquo;t changed.&nbsp; They are: <strong>&lsquo;Everyone Wins&rsquo;</strong>, &lsquo;<strong>Delightful&rsquo;</strong>, <strong>&lsquo;Greatness&rsquo;,</strong> <strong>&lsquo;Revolutionary&rsquo;</strong> and &lsquo;<strong>Integrity&rsquo;</strong>.&nbsp; Even through all of our iterations, the bases for making decisions about our brand, user experience and company culture have remained constant.&nbsp; Values are often a reflection of the entrepreneur and their dreams, but when there&rsquo;s a team, they become the team&rsquo;s&nbsp;values as well.<br><strong>2. Trust the instincts of one talented person over a committee.</strong> <br>Great creativity is the vision of one exceptionally talented person, so it&rsquo;s vital to choose this person carefully and then trust them.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t try to second-guess their decisions or you&rsquo;ll encourage them to play safe, then they&rsquo;ll make boring and wrong decisions.&nbsp; Note that safe creative decisions and disastrous creative decisions tend to be the same thing! &nbsp; <br>Don&rsquo;t think that by involving a committee you&rsquo;ll get more buy-in, that people will feel more empowered to promote the result.&nbsp; If the creative result is brilliant, everyone will want to be associated with it no matter whose vision it was.<br><strong>3. Know and test your target market</strong> <br>In music, we had only the vaguest ideas of our target market.&nbsp; There was no science behind how we defined the audience for an artist.&nbsp; Music is somewhat easier than launching a new product, as you can piggyback onto the market of other artists.<br>But if you&rsquo;re launching a new product like Posse, you have to think through your approach in much more detail.&nbsp; Recently, we had to choose how to design our stores and town, and had five artists submit concepts.&nbsp; They were all good but very different.&nbsp; My first thought was to share the designs with as many people as I could to get feedback.&nbsp; I sent them to about fifty friends and our whole team.&nbsp; Everyone had a strong and different opinion &ndash; all five had about the same number of lovers and haters.&nbsp; It was very confusing!<br>To help make a decision, we decided to define our target market and test people only in that market.&nbsp; But would that give us a result that was too niche?&nbsp; I decided to define and test our target market, which wouldn&rsquo;t be everyone but would be big.<br>One thing I am good at is spotting great creative talent when I see it, and by following a framework of defining our values, trusting the talent, knowing and testing our target market I feel like I&rsquo;m in a much better position to make critical creative decisions that will define our product.', 'Tips on making creative decisions', 'Define your values.

With more than $3 million in investment behind me, this was a frightening, stressful discovery! &nbsp;What next?<br>First, we had to look at our site from the perspective of a customer / user. &nbsp;What would they want Posse to do? &nbsp;What real world problems do they have that we can solve? &nbsp;Then, how can we make the site so original, so fun and so magical that when they use it they can&rsquo;t wait to run out and tell their friends. &nbsp;Only if we could figure out how to design a product that people loved would we have a shot at creating something successful.<br>We approached the process of finding our new strategy in three phases.<br><strong>1. What do users want?</strong> <br>If users are going to engage with our platform then we&rsquo;d have to solve real and significant problems they face in the real world. &nbsp;To find this I ran a series of fourteen focus groups and over thirty one-on-one user interviews. I can only say I found the process incredibly helpful. &nbsp;True, people won&rsquo;t tell you what they want &ndash; that&rsquo;s for the entrepreneur to dream up. &nbsp;But by asking questions you can learn about their sore spots, where they are frustrated in their lives. &nbsp;The questions I asked at these focus groups led to answers that helped me understand the customer problems we could solve.<br><strong>2. How can we make it fun?</strong> <br>There&rsquo;s so much competition that if I&rsquo;m to get excited about something it must be fun, so original it feels like magic.  I started to research gamification and I found a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6O1gNVeaE4g" target="_blank" title="clip of a guy called Gabe Zichermann on YouTube.">clip of a guy called Gabe Zichermann on YouTube</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;I played this clip to the whole team at lunchtime and we all concluded we needed to design Posse as a game.<br>Next, I ran a two-hour strategy session every day for a month (including weekends). &nbsp;Each day, the sessions involved different people. &nbsp;Sometimes it was small groups of members of the Posse team.&nbsp; Some days we&rsquo;d hammer away and only make a little progress. &nbsp;But generally, something, perhaps a comment or observation, would emerge from each session to spark an idea that bore fruit in the next. &nbsp;<br><strong>3. How will it work?</strong> <br>The next issue was, how would the whole thing fit together? What are the rules of the game?&nbsp; How will the pages look?&nbsp; How will we engage users?&nbsp; How long will it take to build? &nbsp;We split up into small groups, tackled different parts of the problem, and then came together as a whole team to find consensus. &nbsp;Everyone had&nbsp;different opinions about things and we argued these out. <br>Instead of banging away, knowing that the fundamentals were wrong, we weren&rsquo;t afraid to go back to the drawing board and start again from scratch.<br>I also think that the intense four-month strategy process helped us discover any potential land-mines that would kill the product, and to design something that (hopefully) people will love.', 'The process of finding new strategy ', 'What do users want?

Let&rsquo;s get started.<br><strong>1. &nbsp;Learn how to speak in public</strong>. &nbsp;I raised most of my first big funding round by speaking at three separate Sydney pitch events. &nbsp;As I&rsquo;ve described, I had zero public speaking experience and was terrified of addressing a group of people in a room. &nbsp;So I signed up for a ten week course. I learned how to connect with an audience, project my voice, use body language, and speak to time. &nbsp;Most importantly, I overcame my dread of public speaking so I could concentrate on getting my message across. <br><strong>2. Build a narrative that will captivate and inspire.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;You have one minute to win people&rsquo;s attention. &nbsp;Always start your pitch with a story that clearly articulates the problem your product will solve in a way they can relate to. &nbsp;The listener must understand who has the problem and what it is before they can start to engage in your solution. &nbsp;<br>Next, you explain how your product will solve the problem: inspire your listener at the size of the opportunity. &nbsp;But if your product is for a more niche market then you need to show how big the market is.<br><strong>3. Show why you are the person to do this:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors look for an entrepreneur who&rsquo;s had previous success and understands the market they are entering. &nbsp;Try to find a clever way to establish this as early as possible, as your credibility will change the way they listen to the rest of the pitch. &nbsp;<br><strong>4. Use exciting visuals:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Every book you read on presenting will tell you: don&rsquo;t use boring visuals with lots of words or graphs that people can&rsquo;t read! &nbsp;But, almost every entrepreneur does this. &nbsp;PowerPoint or other visual presentations work by helping to give your presentation structure and driving home points. &nbsp;<br><strong>5. Know your stuff</strong>: Two things you must know back to front before you start pitching: a) Your competitors, and b) Your numbers. &nbsp;Build an overview of both of these into your pitch so you can show you&rsquo;ve thought things through. You should have scoped out the market for other companies doing similar things to you.&nbsp;<br>You need to have a financial model. You must demonstrate a clear plan to investors; they&rsquo;re entitled to know how you&rsquo;ll spend their money and how you intend to make money in the long run. &nbsp;Investors love asking about your projected profit in two years&rsquo; time, how many sales people or how much marketing you&rsquo;ll require to reach that many customers, what it will cost, the potential for this in five years&rsquo; time, what percentage of the total market you anticipate, and is that realistic? &nbsp;<br><strong>6. Practise. </strong>&nbsp;Once you&rsquo;ve built your pitch, go out and deliver it to as many people as you possibly can. &nbsp;Each person you pitch to will probably recommend that you see someone else (even if they don&rsquo;t want to invest).&nbsp;It takes a long time, but after each meeting you work out how to improve your pitch. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll find yourself rearranging the PowerPoint slides, adding extra information they found exciting, deleting slides that seem irrelevant. &nbsp;Each potential investor will ask you different questions, which prepares you for when you meet the ones that really count.', 'How to deliver a powerful pitch', 'Learn how to speak in public.

What are the legal relationships between you, the buyer and the seller?<br>You need to be clear on the rights and obligations of each party in each relationship. &nbsp;Your sellers must have the right to sell their product or service, must provide accurate descriptions, and must fulfill the obligation to sell the product or service. <br>You need well-drafted business terms and conditions to clarify the relationships, to minimise and deal with <a href="http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/featured/small-business-welcomes-creation-of-new-ombudsman-02052014.html" target="_blank">disputes</a>, and to limit your liability.<br><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>How does the money flow?</strong> <br>You need to decide how money will move between the parties. How will you get paid? How will buyers pay? How will sellers receive funds? <br>Questions to ask are:<br><ul> <li>Will users pay a fee to use your marketplace?</li><li>Will you receive commission from buyers when they purchase a product or service through your website?</li><li>Will you receive the total payment, then pay a portion to the seller?</li><li>Alternatively, will you receive a fee, then the buyer and seller interact and pay directly?</li><li>How will payments be made?</li></ul><strong>3.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>What are the intellectual property rights and issues?</strong> <br>First, you need to ensure that your business&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dynamicbusiness.com.au/entrepreneur-profile/the-prenup-for-co-founders-26112013.html" target="_blank">intellectual property</a> is protected. You need to own or have the right to use your business name, logo, and any other branding. <br>Your marketplace terms and conditions need to state that the material on your marketplace is owned or licensed by you. &nbsp;The market standard approach is that users have a right to use the marketplace, but no rights to reproduce, use or modify your material, unless expressly agreed.<br>The terms should address user content. Your sellers must warrant that the descriptions they provide of goods or services for sale, are accurate and complete. Your buyers must warrant that they will uphold their end of the bargain, e.g. pay the price bid.', 'Understand your online marketplace by asking these 3 questions', 'What are the legal relationships?

It is wise to sit down at an early stage to discuss how things will work between the co-founders. <br><strong>Shares are remuneration, what if my co-founder stops working? </strong> <br>New businesses are often not able to pay market salaries. Founders often receive shares in lieu of salary.&nbsp; <br>How do you ensure your co-founder does the work they were brought on to do?&nbsp; You can agree duties up front, but you may not want to be too precise, as new businesses need flexible staff. A better approach is to agree goals, broad areas and time commitments. <br><strong>I&rsquo;m working for shares, can I be diluted?</strong> <br>Employee shareholders may give up considerable salaries to work in the new business. Shares are an important part of their decision. The shareholders&rsquo; agreement should set out how new shares can be issued. <br><strong>We&rsquo;ve had a falling out, what happens to the shares? &nbsp;</strong> <br>It is wise to agree in advance what you will do if you cannot work together.&nbsp; A well-advised company will agree how shares will be sold and the valuation.

The investor&rsquo;s right to appoint a Director is compromised if the founder can remove the investor&rsquo;s Director.<br>What voting power and rights will each Director have?<br>The Company is managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors. Generally, the Board makes decisions, unless the <a href="https://legalvision.com.au/documents/shareholders-agreement/" target="_blank">Shareholders Agreement</a>, Constitution or Rules says a decision must be made by the Shareholders at a General Meeting.<br>It is crucial to determine what power each Director has, including:<br><br>Will each Director have 1 vote, or will their voting power reflect their percentage shareholding?<br>If each Director has 1 vote, in a 2 Director company, how will you break a dead-lock?

What requires a unanimous vote, i.e. both Directors?<br><br>How to break a dead-lock between Directors?<br>What to do if you cannot resolve a dispute? This can be addressed in the Shareholders&rsquo; Agreement. Some solutions are:<br>(a)Require the parties to meet to resolve the issue, i.e. first the Directors meet, then (if different people) the Shareholders meet. What if the dispute is still not resolved?<br>(b)Agree in advance that you will be bound by the decision made at alternative dispute resolution. What if you do not want to go to a third party?<br>(c)The majority Shareholder can buy out the minority Shareholder at an agreed price, e.g. fair market value as determined by an independent valuer. The risk is that the majority Shareholder will refuse to agree a solution, to trigger this clause. The benefit is that it gives a way forward if there is a severe relationship breakdown. <br>Please note: A&nbsp;<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s9.html" target="_blank">Director</a>&nbsp;must exercise their powers and discharge their duties with a reasonable degree of care and diligence, in good faith in the best&nbsp;<a href="http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s601waa.html" target="_blank">interests</a>&nbsp;of the Company and for a proper purpose.<br>What decisions will the Board make, as compared to Management?<br>The Shareholders Agreement sets out how often the Board meets and what they decide. If you are an Executive Director you may prefer more decisions to be made by management. <br>What if the investor wants to sell?<br>The founder needs rights so they are not left with an unfamiliar and possibly adverse shareholder. Protections include:<br>(a)Right of first refusal, so the founder or the company has first option to purchase the investor&rsquo;s shares;<br>(bTag-along rights, so the founder &lsquo;tags-along&rsquo; with the purchase, at the same price that the buyer is paying for the investor&rsquo;s shares, which generally must be no less than market price.<br>In conclusion, the right investor can transform a start-up.
